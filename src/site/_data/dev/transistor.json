Paints, varnishes and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning, disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing and hobby products.&nbsp;</li><li>Most residential forced air-heating systems and air-conditioning systems do not bring outdoor air into the house mechanically, and infiltration and natural ventilation are relied upon to bring outdoor air into the home. Advanced designs for new homes are starting to add a mechanical feature that brings outdoor air into the home through the HVAC system. Some of these designs include energy efficient heat recovery ventilators to mitigate the cost of cooling and heating this air during the summer and winter.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Source: NY Times</div><ul><li>Indoor air pollution has been linked to a wide variety of adverse health effects, including headaches, respiratory problems, frequent colds, and sore throats, chronic cough, skin rashes, eye irritation, lethargy, dizziness and memory lapses.</li><li>Long-term effects may include an increased risk of cancer. Though children, the elderly and those with chronic ailments like asthma, allergies and heart and lung diseases seem especially vulnerable, symptoms may also occur in otherwise normal, healthy persons</li><li>The pollution problem is most serious in homes tightly sealed to keep out the winter cold (or heat). In a typical ''leaky'' house, all the air is exchanged with fresh outdoor air about once an hour, but a well-sealed house may take four to 10 times longer to completely replace the indoor air. This allows an enormous buildup of potentially harmful substances in the air.</li><li>A Harvard study showed that children living in homes with gas stoves had a significant reduction in lung function. A British study revealed an increase in colds and bronchitis among children whose homes had gas ovens. Nitrogen dioxide has been implicated in longterm respiratory problems, and possibly heart disease and cancer.</li><li>Gas ranges should be fitted with a hood that is vented to the outside, and the vent should be turned on whenever a burner is lighted or the oven in use.<br><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Improving Home Air Quality&nbsp;</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Source: EPA.gov</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Natural ventilation from windows and doors when weather permits</li><li>Reduce and remove pollutants, (ex. cooking, cleaning, smoke)</li><li>Plants may help but the evidence is inconclusive&nbsp;</li><li>To filter particles, choose a portable air cleaner that has a clean air delivery rate (CADR) that is large enough for the size of the room or area in which you will use it.

Most portable air cleaners and furnace/HVAC filters can filter particles from the air. Some can filter the small particles of greatest health concern (PM2.5). There are also air cleaners and filters that can filter both particles and gases. The longer the air cleaner runs, the more air it filters. Note that it is always important to reduce or remove the sources of indoor air pollutants and to ventilate with clean outdoor air. Filtration does not replace the need to control pollutants and ventilate. - epa.gov&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Can I test the air in my house?</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, an indoor air quality monitor can be purchased.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Resources:</div><div><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdf\">https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdfhttps://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-07/documents/guide_to_air_cleaners_in_the_home_2nd_edition.pdf</a></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/introduction-indoor-air-quality\">https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/introduction-indoor-air-quality</a></div><div><br></div><div><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/28/garden/dangers-of-indoor-air-pollution.html?pagewanted=all\">https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/28/garden/dangers-of-indoor-air-pollution.html?pagewanted=all</a></div><div><br></div><div>Air filters increase test scores:</div><div><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/8/21051869/indoor-air-pollution-student-achievement\">https://www.vox.com/2020/1/8/21051869/indoor-air-pollution-student-achievement</a></div><div><br></div><div>Best Air Purifier Review and why itâ€™s needed:</div><div><a href=\"https://mommypotamus.com/best-air-purifier/\">https://mommypotamus.com/best-air-purifier/</a></div><div><a href=\"https://wellnessmama.com/346605/air-filters/\">https://wellnessmama.com/346605/air-filters/</a></div><div><br><br></div>","created_at":"2020-07-19T20:31:14.015Z","updated_at":"2020-08-02T15:03:47.956Z","formatted_published_at":"August 2, 2020","duration_in_mmss":"37:51","share_url":"https://share.transistor.fm/s/a483920d","formatted_summary":"Home Air Quality!","embed_html":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless src=\"https://share.transistor.fm/e/a483920d\"></iframe>","embed_html_dark":"<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"180\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless src=\"https://share.transistor.fm/e/a483920d/dark\"></iframe>","audio_processing":false,"type":"full"},"relationships":{"show":{"data":{"id":"4186","type":"show"}}}},{"id":"299137","type":"episode","attributes":{"title":"Parenting -
