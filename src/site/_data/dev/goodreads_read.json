As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family.<br /><br />All the while, Farrow and his producer faced a degree of resistance that could not be explained - until now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood, to Washington, and beyond.<br /><br />This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability and silence victims of abuse - and it's the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.<br /><br />Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, <em>Catch and Kill</em> breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power - and sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook the culture.","authors":{"author":{"id":"17176042","name":"Ronan Farrow","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17176042.Ronan_Farrow","average_rating":"4.41","ratings_count":"75049","text_reviews_count":"8724"}},"published":"","work":{"id":"72177046","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v2.9f56aada-9e91-4ca0-97f5-4ffc2c21a36e"}},{"id":{"_":"954948","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1880032422","isbn13":"9781880032428","text_reviews_count":{"_":"6","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.OQIJGyoq3eSUNh9G0fgN-w","title":"Creating Affluence: Wealth Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities","title_without_series":"Creating Affluence: Wealth Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/954948.Creating_Affluence","num_pages":"112","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Amber-Allen Publ., New World Library","publication_day":"30","publication_year":"1993","publication_month":"8","average_rating":"3.93","ratings_count":"1583","description":"With clear and simple wisdom, Deepak Chopra explores the full meaning of wealth consciousness and presents an A-Z plan for creating affluence and fulfilment on all levels of our lives.

You'll never find a wiser advisor with a bigger heart.” -- Malachi Rempen: Filmmaker, cartoonist, author and self-described ruffian <br /> <br />This book grew out of a series of letters to my daughter concerning various things—mostly about money and investing—she was not yet quite ready to hear. <br /> <br />Since money is the single most powerful tool we have for navigating this complex world we’ve created, understanding it is critical. <br /> <br />“But Dad,” she once said, “I know money is important. I just don’t want to spend my life thinking about it.” This was eye-opening. I love this stuff. But most people have better things to do with their precious time. Bridges to build, diseases to cure, treaties to negotiate, mountains to climb, technologies to create, children to teach, businesses to run. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, benign neglect of things financial leaves you open to the charlatans of the financial world. The people who make investing endlessly complex, because if it can be made complex it becomes more profitable for them, more expensive for us, and we are forced into their waiting arms. <br /> <br />Here’s an important truth: Complex investments exist only to profit those who create and sell them. Not only are they more costly to the investor, they are less effective. <br /> <br />The simple approach I created for her and present now to you, is not only easy to understand and implement, it is more powerful than any other. <br /> <br />Together we’ll explore: <br /> <br />  Debt: Why you must avoid it and what to do if you have it.  <br />  The importance of having F-you Money.  <br />  How to think about money, and the unique way understanding this is key to building your wealth.  <br />  Where traditional investing advice goes wrong and what actually works.  <br />  What the stock market really is and how it really works.  <br />  Why the stock market always goes up and why most people still lose money investing in it.  <br />  How to invest in a raging bull, or bear, market.  <br />  Specific investments to implement these strategies.  <br />  The Wealth Building and Wealth Preservation phases of your investing life and why they are not always tied to your age.  <br />  How your asset allocation is tied to those phases and how to choose it.  <br />  How to simplify the sometimes confusing world of 401(k), 403(b), TSP, IRA and Roth accounts.  <br />  TRFs (Target Retirement Funds), HSAs (Health Savings Accounts) and RMDs (Required Minimum Distributions).  <br />  What investment firm to use and why the one I recommend is so far superior to the competition.  <br />  Why you should be very cautious when engaging an investment advisor and whether you need to at all.  <br />  Why and how you can be conned, and how to avoid becoming prey.  <br />  Why I don’t recommend dollar cost averaging.  <br />  What financial independence looks like and how to have your money support you.  <br />  What the 4% rule is and how to use it to safely spend your wealth.  <br />  The truth behind Social Security.

She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: a world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course, <i>progress</i>.<br /><br />Anna arrived amidst a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street. But amid the company ski vacations and in-office speakeasies, boyish camaraderie and ride-or-die corporate fealty, a new Silicon Valley began to emerge: one in far over its head, one that enriched itself at the expense of the idyllic future it claimed to be building.<br /><br />Part coming-age-story, part portrait of an already-bygone era, Anna Wiener’s memoir is a rare first-person glimpse into high-flying, reckless startup culture at a time of unchecked ambition, unregulated surveillance, wild fortune, and accelerating political power. With wit, candor, and heart, Anna deftly charts the tech industry’s shift from self-appointed world savior to democracy-endangering liability, alongside a personal narrative of aspiration, ambivalence, and disillusionment.<br /><br />Unsparing and incisive, <i>Uncanny Valley</i> is a cautionary tale, and a revelatory interrogation of a world reckoning with consequences its unwitting designers are only beginning to understand.","authors":{"author":{"id":"3948574","name":"Anna Wiener","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1569785505p5/3948574.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1569785505p2/3948574.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3948574.Anna_Wiener","average_rating":"3.68","ratings_count":"15259","text_reviews_count":"1991"}},"published":"2020","work":{"id":"69908892","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.PhwEhjrJtnYNwXClkorD2Q"}},{"id":{"_":"44600621","type":"integer"},"isbn":"052550883X","isbn13":"9780525508830","text_reviews_count":{"_":"4943","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.8SjuN-eAwtAvqdsH7mLieQ","title":"Dear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets, & Advice for Living Your Best Life","title_without_series":"Dear Girls: Intimate Tales, Untold Secrets, & Advice for Living Your Best Life","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553635552l/44600621._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553635552l/44600621._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44600621-dear-girls","num_pages":"240","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Random House","publication_day":"15","publication_year":"2019","publication_month":"10","average_rating":"3.89","ratings_count":"54746","description":"<b>Ali Wong's heartfelt and hilarious letters to her daughters (the two she put to work while they were still in utero), covering everything they need to know in life, like the unpleasant details of dating, how to be a working mom in a male-dominated profession, and how she trapped their dad.</b><br /><br />In her hit Netflix comedy special <i>Baby Cobra</i>, an eight-month pregnant Ali Wong resonated so heavily that she became a popular Halloween costume. Wong told the world her remarkably unfiltered thoughts on marriage, sex, Asian culture, working women, and why you never see new mom comics on stage but you sure see plenty of new dads.<br /><br />The sharp insights and humor are even more personal in this completely original collection. She shares the wisdom she's learned from a life in comedy and reveals stories from her life off stage, including the brutal singles life in New York (i.e. the inevitable confrontation with erectile dysfunction), reconnecting with her roots (and drinking snake blood) in Vietnam, tales of being a wild child growing up in San Francisco, and parenting war stories.

It would not stop there. Before long, the business had turned into a sprawling multinational conglomerate engaged in almost every conceivable aspect of criminal mayhem. Yachts carrying $100 million in cocaine. Safe houses in Hong Kong filled with gold bars. Shipments of methamphetamine from North Korea. Weapons deals with Iran. Mercenary armies in Somalia. Teams of hitmen in the Philippines. Encryption programs so advanced that the government could not break them.<br /><br />The man behind it all, pulling the strings from a laptop in Manila, was Paul Calder Le Roux—a reclusive programmer turned criminal genius who could only exist in the networked world of the twenty-first century, and the kind of self-made crime boss that American law enforcement had never imagined.<br /><br />For half a decade, DEA agents played a global game of cat-and-mouse with Le Roux as he left terror and chaos in his wake. Each time they came close, he would slip away. It would take relentless investigative work, and a shocking betrayal from within his organization, to catch him. And when he was finally caught, the story turned again, as Le Roux struck a deal to bring down his own organization and the people he had once employed.<br /><br />Award-winning investigative journalist Evan Ratliff spent four years piecing together this intricate puzzle, chasing LeRoux's empire and his shadowy henchmen around the world, conducting hundreds of interviews and uncovering thousands of documents. The result is a riveting, unprecedented account of a crime boss built by and for the digital age.<br /><br /><b>Advance praise for <em>The Mastermind</em></b><br /><br />“As directors, we spend countless hours imagining heightened plots and memorable characters that will leave a lasting impression on audiences. The true tale of obsession, genius, intrigue, and vengeance detailed in <em>The Mastermind</em> is as gripping and cinematic as anything we could endeavor to conjure up.”—<b>Joe and Anthony Russo, directors of <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War,</em> and <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></b><br /><br />“With his relentless and fearless reporting, Evan Ratliff has pried open a hidden world filled with high-tech gangsters and drug kingpins and double-crossers and stone-cold hitmen. The story is as fascinating as it is terrifying, and it is one that will hold you in its grip.”—<b>David Grann, author of <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em></b><br /><br />“If truth is stranger than fiction, then <em>The Mastermind</em> is the truest book you’ll read this year. The only thing predictable about it is how quickly you’ll turn the pages.”—<b>Noah Hawley, author of <em>Before the Fall</em> and creator of the TV series <em>Fargo</em></b><br /> <br />“This is a mesmerizing, absolutely bonkers story about a man as brilliant as he is villainous. You’ll find yourself sucked in, freaked out, and ultimately blown away by Ratliff's storytelling and tireless reporting. <em>The Mastermind</em> is a masterpiece.”—<b>Nick Thompson, editor-in-chief, <em>Wired</em></b>","authors":{"author":{"id":"4565084","name":"Evan Ratliff","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1457468273p5/4565084.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1457468273p2/4565084.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4565084.Evan_Ratliff","average_rating":"4.00","ratings_count":"4092","text_reviews_count":"452"}},"published":"2019","work":{"id":"64358571","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.PVWrSxdGNuYpArrNIT4vNA"}},{"id":{"_":"48989372","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1101906324","isbn13":"9781101906323","text_reviews_count":{"_":"1464","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.6_hbFfiWvTdbI1Dy","title":"A Very Punchable Face","title_without_series":"A Very Punchable Face","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1585145237l/48989372._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1585145237l/48989372._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48989372-a-very-punchable-face","num_pages":"312","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Crown Publishing Group (NY)","publication_day":"14","publication_year":"2020","publication_month":"7","average_rating":"4.25","ratings_count":"11219","description":"If there’s one trait that makes someone well suited to comedy, it’s being able to take a punch—metaphorically and, occasionally, physically. <br /><br />From growing up in a family of firefighters on Staten Island to commuting three hours a day to high school and “seeing the sights” (like watching a Russian woman throw a stroller off the back of a ferry), to attending Harvard while Facebook was created, Jost shares how he has navigated the world like a slightly smarter Forrest Gump.<br /><br />You’ll also discover things about Jost that will surprise and confuse you, like how Jimmy Buffett saved his life, how Czech teenagers attacked him with potato salad, how an insect laid eggs inside his legs, and how he competed in a twenty-five-man match at WrestleMania (and almost won). You’ll go behind the scenes at SNL and Weekend Update (where he’s written some of the most memorable sketches and jokes of the past fifteen years). And you’ll experience the life of a touring stand-up comedian—from performing in rural college cafeterias at noon to opening for Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall.<br /><br />For every accomplishment (hosting the Emmys), there is a setback (hosting the Emmys). And for every absurd moment (watching paramedics give CPR to a raccoon), there is an honest, emotional one (recounting his mother’s experience on the scene of the Twin Towers’ collapse on 9/11).

By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of \"why I did stand-up and why I walked away.\" <br /><br />Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Shopgirl</i> and <i>The Pleasure of My Company</i>, and a regular contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i>, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written. <br /><br />At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. <br /><br />Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times-the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of <i>The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour</i> in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> in the seventies.<br /><br />Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. <i>Born Standing Up</i> is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.","authors":{"author":{"id":"7103","name":"Steve Martin","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1585425013p5/7103.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1585425013p2/7103.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7103.Steve_Martin","average_rating":"3.74","ratings_count":"222589","text_reviews_count":"14078"}},"published":"2008","work":{"id":"3315115","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.u2LjV_2VOT5zVQQK4o2ENA"}},{"id":{"_":"36800891","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1491969555","isbn13":"9781491969557","text_reviews_count":{"_":"7","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.aRiIbWrpcDkP8FupDs1X5A","title":"Head First Go","title_without_series":"Head First Go","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1555109044l/36800891._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1555109044l/36800891._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36800891-head-first-go","num_pages":"560","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"O'Reilly Media","publication_day":"7","publication_year":"2019","publication_month":"5","average_rating":"4.26","ratings_count":"46","description":"<b>What will you learn from this book?</b><br /><br />Go makes it easy to build software that's simple, reliable, and efficient.

He’s a master thief, expert at disguise, and not averse to violence when it’s needed. It’s no accident, though, that Riley targets the wealthiest 0.1 percent and is willing to kill them when they’re in his way: he despises the degenerate and immoral rich and loves stealing their undeserved and unearned valuables.<br />  <br /> In this series launch, Riley aims for an extraordinary target in a heist that will make history. Riley will try to steal the Crown Jewels of Iran. Yes, these jewels are worth billions, but the true attraction for grabbing them comes down to one simple fact: it can’t be done. Stealing these jewels is absolutely impossible. The collection is guarded by space-age electronics and <i>two</i> teams of heavily armed mercenaries.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts—Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak—that we owe many of the great contributions to society. <br /><br />In <i>Quiet, </i>Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts—from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, <i>Quiet </i>has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.<br /><br />Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader’s guide and bonus content.","authors":{"author":{"id":"4101935","name":"Susan Cain","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1315319296p5/4101935.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1315319296p2/4101935.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4101935.Susan_Cain","average_rating":"4.06","ratings_count":"337985","text_reviews_count":"24582"}},"published":"2012","work":{"id":"13387396","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.i0uNH8_A-2WFPGyqkxhKUg"}},{"id":{"_":"1906500","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1400044111","isbn13":"9781400044115","text_reviews_count":{"_":"254","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.TsRudopr-zIvsz6-rCVK1g","title":"McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld","title_without_series":"McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320554929l/1906500._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320554929l/1906500._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1906500.McMafia","num_pages":"398","format":"","edition_information":"First Edition","publisher":"Alfred A.

No one would foresee that the greatest success story to arise from these events would be the globalization of organized crime. <br />\"McMafia\" is a fearless, encompassing, wholly authoritative investigation of the now proven ability of organized crime worldwide to find and service markets driven by a seemingly insatiable demand for illegal wares. Whether discussing the Russian mafia, Colombian drug cartels, or Chinese labor smugglers, Misha Glenny makes clear how organized crime feeds off the poverty of the developing world, how it exploits new technology in the forms of cybercrime and identity theft, and how both global crime and terror are fueled by an identical source: the triumphant material affluence of the West. <br />To trace the disparate strands of this hydra-like story, Glenny talked to police, victims, politicians, and members of the global underworld in eastern Europe, North and South America, Africa, the Middle East, China, Japan, and India. The story of organized crime's phenomenal, often shocking growth is truly the central political story of our time. \"McMafia \"will change the way we look at the world.","authors":{"author":{"id":"50524","name":"Misha Glenny","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1211320422p5/50524.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1211320422p2/50524.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/50524.Misha_Glenny","average_rating":"3.93","ratings_count":"9258","text_reviews_count":"864"}},"published":"","work":{"id":"3006151","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.CPGi6sy_fL1G30TkUGwyOw"}},{"id":{"_":"27993244","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":{"nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"_":"1039","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YwFeANP_nNWetlshTqmMtA","title":"Never Never (Detective Harriet Blue, #1)","title_without_series":"Never Never","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1458068755l/27993244._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1458068755l/27993244._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27993244-never-never","num_pages":"342","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Century","publication_day":"25","publication_year":"2016","publication_month":"8","average_rating":"3.64","ratings_count":"15133","description":"When Sydney police department sex crimes detective Harriet Blue is called into her boss’s office, she never imagined it would be to tell her that her brother is the prime suspect in the brutal murders of three women.<p>Shocked and in denial, Harry is transferred to Perth to avoid the media exposure this case will attract.

Fearful of a repeat on the one hundredth anniversary of the nightmarish contagion, Jack autopsies the woman within hours of her demise and discovers some striking anomalies: first, that she has had a heart transplant, and second, that, against all odds, her DNA matches that of the transplanted heart.<br /><br />Although the facts don't add up to influenza, Jack must race against the clock to identify the woman and determine what kind of virus could wreak such havoc--a task made more urgent when two other victims succumb to a similar rapid death. But nothing makes sense until his investigation leads him into the fascinating realm of CRISPR/CAS9, a gene-editing biotechnology that's captured the imagination of the medical community. . . and the attention of its most unethical members. Drawn into the dark underbelly of the organ transplant market, Jack will come face-to-face with a megalomaniacal businessman willing to risk human lives in order to conquer a lucrative new frontier in medicine--and if Jack's not careful, the next life lost might be his own.","authors":{"author":{"id":"19697","name":"Robin Cook","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1289871734p5/19697.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1289871734p2/19697.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19697.Robin_Cook","average_rating":"3.79","ratings_count":"311910","text_reviews_count":"12073"}},"published":"2018","work":{"id":"58461138","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.YLirdSaCJ3OyuetIlV11Og"}},{"id":{"_":"18342283","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0399160477","isbn13":"9780399160479","text_reviews_count":{"_":"728","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.bShKSVN1F-1nN1C4SlfHrg","title":"Command Authority (Jack Ryan, #9)","title_without_series":"Command Authority","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18342283-command-authority","num_pages":"740","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"G.P.

Ryan's dogged tenacity uncovered not only financial deceit, but also the existence of a KGB assassin, code-named Zenith. He was never able to find the killer. But in the shadowy world of covert operations, nothing stays hidden forever. In the present, a new strongman has emerged in the ever-chaotic Russian republic -- the enigmatic President Valeri Volodin. His rise to power was meteoric, but shrouded in deception and treachery. The foundations of his personal empire are built on a bloody secret from his past, and he will eliminate anyone who comes close to that truth. For he has set in motion a plot to return Russia to its former glory and might, with the rest of the world once again trembling in fear of the mighty Bear. When an old friend of the Ryans is poisoned by a radioactive agent, the trail leads to Russia. And Jack Ryan, Jr. -- aided by his compatriots John Clark and the covert warriors of the secretive Campus -- must delve into an international conflict thirty years in the making, and finish what his father started.","authors":{"author":{"id":"3892","name":"Tom Clancy","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3892.Tom_Clancy","average_rating":"4.04","ratings_count":"1415097","text_reviews_count":"24157"}},"published":"2013","work":{"id":"25897610","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.BMyoCNyeNC7llK3EE1MpDA"}},{"id":{"_":"52530434","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1432871730","isbn13":"9781432871734","text_reviews_count":{"_":"16","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.F83ZayuzfFb4-JPf","title":"Tom Clancy Code of Honor","title_without_series":"Tom Clancy Code of Honor","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52530434-tom-clancy-code-of-honor","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_year":"","publication_month":"","average_rating":"4.24","ratings_count":"3520","description":"<b>\n  <b>As President of the United States, Jack Ryan has faced many challenges, but none have been as personal as this and never has he been this helpless in the face of evil in the latest entry in Tom Clancy's #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series.</b>\n</b><br /><br />Father Pat West, S.J. was a buddy of the young Jack Ryan when they were both undergraduates at Boston College.

Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans. <p> Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, <i>Moneyball</i> is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (<i>Liar's Poker</i>, <i>The New New Thing</i>), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes <i>Moneyball</i> an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. <i>--John Moe</i></p>","authors":{"author":{"id":"776","name":"Michael   Lewis","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1317447168p5/776.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1317447168p2/776.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/776.Michael_Lewis","average_rating":"4.14","ratings_count":"627340","text_reviews_count":"34435"}},"published":"2004","work":{"id":"416305","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6lJ4A0AJRJwgkJqbX6ZJcQ"}},{"id":{"_":"26046333","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1784740241","isbn13":"9781784740245","text_reviews_count":{"_":"730","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.OngTzgK9aSmmduJpLxEMYQ","title":"Designing Your Life: Build a Life that Works for You","title_without_series":"Designing Your Life: Build a Life that Works for You","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1476133952l/26046333._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1476133952l/26046333._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26046333-designing-your-life","num_pages":"240","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Chatto  Windus","publication_day":"15","publication_year":"2016","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"3.94","ratings_count":"12006","description":"<b>*** The #1 New York Times Bestseller *** </b><br /><br />Whether we’re 20, 40, 60 or older, many of us are still looking for an answer to that perennial question, ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ In <i>Designing Your Life</i>, Silicon Valley design innovators Bill Burnett and Dave Evans use their expertise to help you work out what you want – and how to get it.<br /><br />Their phenomenally successful Life Design course has been tried and tested by thousands of people, from students to mid-career professionals to retirees contemplating a whole new future.

By staying small, one can have freedom to pursue more meaningful pleasures in life, and avoid the headaches that result from dealing with employees, long meetings, or worrying about expansion. <i>Company of One</i> introduces this unique business strategy and explains how to make it work for you, including how to generate cash flow on an ongoing basis.<br /><br /> Paul Jarvis left the corporate world when he realized that working in a high-pressure, high profile world was not his idea of success.

Bannon had long sensed that deep within America's soul lurked an explosive tension. Cambridge Analytica had the data to prove it, and in 2016 Bannon had a presidential campaign to use as his proving ground.<br /><br />Christopher Wylie might have seemed an unlikely figure to be at the center of such an operation. Canadian and liberal in his politics, he was only twenty-four when he got a job with a London firm that worked with the U.K. Ministry of Defense and was charged putatively with helping to build a team of data scientists to create new tools to identify and combat radical extremism online. In short order, those same military tools were turned to political purposes, and Cambridge Analytica was born. <br /><br />Wylie's decision to become a whistleblower prompted the largest data crime investigation in history. His story is both exposé and dire warning about a sudden problem born of very new and powerful capabilities. It has not only exposed the profound vulnerabilities and profound carelessness in the enormous companies that drive the attention economy, it has also exposed the profound vulnerabilities of democracy itself.

After he had a panic attack on live television, he went on a strange and circuitous journey that ultimately led him to become one of meditation’s most vocal public proponents.<br /><br />Here’s what he’s fixated on now: Science suggests that meditation can lower blood pressure, mitigate depression and anxiety, and literally rewire key parts of the brain, among numerous other benefits. And yet there are millions of people who want to meditate but aren’t actually practicing. What’s holding them back?<br /><br />In this guide to mindfulness and meditation for beginners and experienced meditators alike, Harris and his friend Jeff Warren, a masterful teacher and “Meditation MacGyver,” embark on a cross-country quest to tackle the myths, misconceptions, and self-deceptions that stop people from meditating. They rent a rock-star tour bus (whose previous occupants were Parliament Funkadelic) and travel across eighteen states, talking to scores of would-be meditators—including parents, military cadets, police officers, and even a few celebrities. They create a taxonomy of the most common issues (“I suck at this,” “I don’t have the time,” etc.) and offer up science-based life hacks to help people overcome them.<br /><br />The book is filled with game-changing and deeply practical meditation instructions. Amid it all unspools the strange and hilarious story of what happens when a congenitally sarcastic, type-A journalist and a groovy Canadian mystic embark on an epic road trip into America’s neurotic underbelly, as well as their own.","authors":{"author":{"id":"7890536","name":"Dan   Harris","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393858699p5/7890536.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393858699p2/7890536.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7890536.Dan_Harris","average_rating":"3.91","ratings_count":"88542","text_reviews_count":"6969"}},"published":"2017","work":{"id":"56237226","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.0CD8DQpb2Lnu6V8MVr1OJQ"}},{"id":{"_":"38357345","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1501197401","isbn13":"9781501197406","text_reviews_count":{"_":"3720","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.SjXfqenmw4b3WDhDiZ-Iyg","title":"My Favorite Half-Night Stand","title_without_series":"My Favorite Half-Night Stand","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1533058458l/38357345._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1533058458l/38357345._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38357345-my-favorite-half-night-stand","num_pages":"384","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Gallery Books","publication_day":"4","publication_year":"2018","publication_month":"12","average_rating":"3.80","ratings_count":"33339","description":"Millie Morris has always been one of the guys. A UC Santa Barbara professor, she’s a female-serial-killer expert who’s quick with a deflection joke and terrible at getting personal.

There’s only one hitch: after making the pact, Millie and one of the guys, Reid Campbell, secretly spend the sexiest half-night of their lives together, but mutually decide the friendship would be better off strictly platonic.<br /><br />But online dating isn’t for the faint of heart. While the guys are inundated with quality matches and potential dates, Millie’s first profile attempt garners nothing but dick pics and creepers. Enter “Catherine”—Millie’s fictional profile persona, in whose make-believe shoes she can be more vulnerable than she’s ever been in person. Soon “Catherine” and Reid strike up a digital pen-pal-ship...but Millie can’t resist temptation in real life, either.

Through Gaiman’s deft and witty prose, these gods emerge with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1221698","name":"Neil Gaiman","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p5/1221698.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1234150163p2/1221698.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1221698.Neil_Gaiman","average_rating":"4.12","ratings_count":"6279744","text_reviews_count":"375915"}},"published":"2018","work":{"id":"51396954","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ZjetaSgZLpRuwbsCvexmjg"}},{"id":{"_":"26156469","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0062407805","isbn13":"9780062407801","text_reviews_count":{"_":"3917","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kbsgSS8iXqbL4YXnG5GuUg","title":"Never Split the Difference","title_without_series":"Never Split the Difference","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1460910517l/26156469._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1460910517l/26156469._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference","num_pages":"274","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Harper Business","publication_day":"17","publication_year":"2016","publication_month":"5","average_rating":"4.39","ratings_count":"63669","description":"<b>A former international hostage negotiator for the FBI offers a new, field-tested approach to high-stakes negotiations—whether in the boardroom or at home.</b><br /><br />After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri, Chris Voss joined the FBI, where his career as a hostage negotiator brought him face-to-face with a range of criminals, including bank robbers and terrorists.

The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.<br /><br />Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, <i>Permanent Record</i> is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online—a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet’s conscience.

A completely practical approach delivered with a nonjudgmental style that makes readers want to do what Sethi says, it is based around the four pillars of personal finance— banking, saving, budgeting, and investing—and the wealth-building ideas of personal entrepreneurship.<br /><br />Sethi covers how to save time by not wasting it managing money; the guns and cars myth of credit cards; how to negotiate like an Indian—the conversation begins with \"no\"; why \"Budgeting Doesn't Have to Suck!\"; how to get things rolling—for real—with only $20; what most people don't understand about taxes; how to get a CEO to take you out to lunch; how to avoid the Super Mario Brothers trap by making your savings work harder than you do; the difference between cheap and frugal; the hidden relationship between money and food. Not to mention his first key lesson: Getting started is more important than being the smartest person in the room. Integrated with his website, where readers can use interactive charts, follow up on the latest information, and join the community, it is a hip blueprint to building wealth and financial security.<br /><br />Every month, 175,000 unique visitors come to Ramit Sethi's website, Iwillteachyoutoberich.com, to discover the path to financial freedom. They praise him thoughtfully (\"Your site summarizes everything I want with my life—to be rich in finances, rich in experience, rich in family blessings,\" --Dan Esparza) and effusively (\"Dude, you rock. I love this site!\" --Richard Wu). The press has caught on, too: \"Ramit Sethi is a rising star in the world of personal finance writing . . . one singularly attuned to the sensibilities of his generation. his style is part frat boy and part silicon Valley geek, with a little bit of San Francisco hipster thrown in\" (San Francisco Chronicle). His writing is smart, his voice is full of attitude, and his ideas are uncommonly sound and refreshingly hype-free.","authors":{"author":{"id":"773057","name":"Ramit Sethi","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1424299028p5/773057.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1424299028p2/773057.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/773057.Ramit_Sethi","average_rating":"4.11","ratings_count":"27330","text_reviews_count":"2272"}},"published":"2009","work":{"id":"4990463","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.5bEraPUrRpBV7dhQTZhK-A"}},{"id":{"_":"52283963","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":{"nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"_":"168","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v3.-m8V6-tw7eEWAaTb","title":"The Mom Test: How to talk to customers & learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you","title_without_series":"The Mom Test: How to talk to customers & learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52283963-the-mom-test","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_year":"","publication_month":"","average_rating":"4.45","ratings_count":"3622","description":"The Mom Test is a quick, practical guide that will save you time, money, and heartbreak.<br /><br />They say you shouldn't ask your mom whether your business is a good idea, because she loves you and will lie to you.

Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, she prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling home-canned peaches and sleeping with her \"head-for-the-hills bag\". In the summer she stewed herbs for her mother, a midwife and healer, and in the winter she salvaged in her father's junkyard.<br /><br />Her father forbade hospitals, so Tara never saw a doctor or nurse. Gashes and concussions, even burns from explosions, were all treated at home with herbalism. The family was so isolated from mainstream society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent.<br /><br />Then, lacking any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. She taught herself enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University, where she studied history, learning for the first time about important world events like the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge. Only then would she wonder if she'd traveled too far, if there was still a way home.<br /><br /><em>Educated</em> is an account of the struggle for self-invention. It is a tale of fierce family loyalty and of the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With the acute insight that distinguishes all great writers, Westover has crafted a universal coming-of-age story that gets to the heart of what an education is and what it offers: the perspective to see one's life through new eyes and the will to change it.<br /><br /><i>Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54756641.here\" title=\"here\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a></i>","authors":{"author":{"id":"16121977","name":"Tara Westover","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506103019p5/16121977.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506103019p2/16121977.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16121977.Tara_Westover","average_rating":"4.46","ratings_count":"843683","text_reviews_count":"71327"}},"published":"2018","work":{"id":"53814228","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.m9wJkXRO9ATRt1X2ny_DUg"}},{"id":{"_":"23463183","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0385537603","isbn13":"9780385537605","text_reviews_count":{"_":"702","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1._DgQrJDEkSxLZgexR1pYzQ","title":"The Billion Dollar Spy: A True Story of Cold War Espionage and Betrayal","title_without_series":"The Billion Dollar Spy: A True Story of Cold War Espionage and Betrayal","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428686782l/23463183._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428686782l/23463183._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463183-the-billion-dollar-spy","num_pages":"336","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Doubleday","publication_day":"7","publication_year":"2015","publication_month":"7","average_rating":"4.21","ratings_count":"9827","description":"<b>From the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning history <i>The Dead Hand</i> comes the riveting story of a spy who cracked open the Soviet military research establishment and a penetrating portrait of the CIA’s Moscow station, an outpost of daring espionage in the last years of the Cold War</b><br /><br />While driving out of the American embassy in Moscow on the evening of February 16, 1978, the chief of the CIA’s Moscow station heard a knock on his car window. A man on the curb handed him an envelope whose contents stunned U.S. intelligence: details of top-secret Soviet research and developments in military technology that were totally unknown to the United States. In the years that followed, the man, Adolf Tolkachev, an engineer in a Soviet military design bureau, used his high-level access to hand over tens of thousands of pages of technical secrets. His revelations allowed America to reshape its weapons systems to defeat Soviet radar on the ground and in the air, giving the United States near total superiority in the skies over Europe.<br /><br />One of the most valuable spies to work for the United States in the four decades of global confrontation with the Soviet Union, Tolkachev took enormous personal risks—but so did the Americans. The CIA had long struggled to recruit and run agents in Moscow, and Tolkachev was a singular breakthrough. Using spy cameras and secret codes as well as face-to-face meetings in parks and on street corners, Tolkachev and his handlers succeeded for years in eluding the feared KGB in its own backyard, until the day came when a shocking betrayal put them all at risk.<br /><br />Drawing on previously secret documents obtained from the CIA and on interviews with participants, David Hoffman has created an unprecedented and poignant portrait of Tolkachev, a man motivated by the depredations of the Soviet state to master the craft of spying against his own country. Stirring, unpredictable, and at times unbearably tense, <i>The Billion Dollar Spy</i> is a brilliant feat of reporting that unfolds like an espionage thriller.","authors":{"author":{"id":"544275","name":"David E.

These are the very same behaviors that typify good soldiering and foster a sense of belonging among troops, whether they’re fighting on the front lines or engaged in non-combat activities away from the action. Drawing from history, psychology, and anthropology, bestselling author Sebastian Junger shows us just how at odds the structure of modern society is with our tribal instincts, arguing that the difficulties many veterans face upon returning home from war do not stem entirely from the trauma they’ve suffered, but also from the individualist societies they must reintegrate into.<br /><br />A 2011 study by the Canadian Forces and Statistics Canada reveals that 78 percent of military suicides from 1972 to the end of 2006 involved veterans. Though these numbers present an implicit call to action, the government is only just taking steps now to address the problems veterans face when they return home. But can the government ever truly eliminate the challenges faced by returning veterans? Or is the problem deeper, woven into the very fabric of our modern existence? Perhaps our circumstances are not so bleak, and simply understanding that beneath our modern guises we all belong to one tribe or another would help us face not just the problems of our nation but of our individual lives as well.<br /><br />Well-researched and compellingly written, this timely look at how veterans react to coming home will reconceive our approach to veteran’s affairs and help us to repair our current social dynamic.","authors":{"author":{"id":"16494","name":"Sebastian Junger","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1458242367p5/16494.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1458242367p2/16494.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16494.Sebastian_Junger","average_rating":"4.08","ratings_count":"166283","text_reviews_count":"8014"}},"published":"2016","work":{"id":"47206763","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.MYuSDIJTIpOg_IUjEVCskw"}},{"id":{"_":"41795733","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0735214484","isbn13":"9780735214484","text_reviews_count":{"_":"2345","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.kuDByzGjVEevBVQqoxo-4Q","title":"Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World","title_without_series":"Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550048292l/41795733._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550048292l/41795733._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range","num_pages":"352","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Riverhead Books","publication_day":"28","publication_year":"2019","publication_month":"5","average_rating":"4.17","ratings_count":"25939","description":"What's the most effective path to success in any domain? It's not what you think. <br /><b>\n  <br />\n</b>Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.<br /><br />David Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.<br /><br />Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, <i>Range</i> makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.","authors":{"author":{"id":"7164089","name":"David   Epstein","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1545945759p5/7164089.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1545945759p2/7164089.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7164089.David_Epstein","average_rating":"4.17","ratings_count":"36479","text_reviews_count":"3509"}},"published":"2019","work":{"id":"65183769","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.dmpkPJ7cHWotWEf7VKgqyg"}},{"id":{"_":"11084145","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1451648537","isbn13":"9781451648539","text_reviews_count":{"_":"16965","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.55oEh7mAhPW_FkeSWIhWPQ","title":"Steve Jobs","title_without_series":"Steve Jobs","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511288482l/11084145._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511288482l/11084145._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs","num_pages":"627","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Simon & Schuster","publication_day":"24","publication_year":"2011","publication_month":"10","average_rating":"4.14","ratings_count":"979637","description":"Walter Isaacson's \"enthralling\" (The New Yorker) worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.","authors":{"author":{"id":"7111","name":"Walter Isaacson","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1192222433p5/7111.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1192222433p2/7111.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7111.Walter_Isaacson","average_rating":"4.12","ratings_count":"1345405","text_reviews_count":"31275"}},"published":"2011","work":{"id":"16005831","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.MvliEan8p7Xgfe4QrGmMLw"}},{"id":{"_":"38900022","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":{"nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"_":"139","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.j-G7YcuT160vXLE3Z46EyQ","title":"The Assault on Intelligence: American National Security in an Age of Lies","title_without_series":"The Assault on Intelligence: American National Security in an Age of Lies","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38900022-the-assault-on-intelligence","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_year":"","publication_month":"","average_rating":"4.05","ratings_count":"1215","description":"","authors":{"author":{"id":"6088573","name":"Michael V.

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

How you, as an educator, respond to students' natural curiosity can help further their own exploration and shape the way they learn today and in the future. The traditional system of education requires students to hold their questions and compliantly stick to the scheduled curriculum. But our job as educators is to provide new and better opportunities for our students. It's time to recognize that compliance doesn't foster innovation, encourage critical thinking, or inspire creativity--and those are the skills our students need to succeed.<br /><br />In <i>The Innovator's Mindset</i>, George Couros encourages teachers and administrators to empower their learners to wonder, to explore--and to become forward-thinking leaders. If we want innovative students, we need innovative educators. In other words, innovation begins with you. Ultimately, innovation is not about a skill set: it's about a mindset. <i>The Innovator's Mindset</i> is for you if:<br />* You are a superintendent, district administrator, or principal who wants to empower your staff to create a culture of innovation<br />* You are a school leader - at any level - and want to help students and educators become their personal best.<br />* You are a teacher who wants to create relevant learning experiences and help students develop the skills they need to be successful.<br /><br />You'll be inspired to:<br />* Connect with other innovative educators<br />* Support teachers and leaders as learners<br />* Tap into the strength of your learning community<br />* Create ongoing opportunities for innovation<br />* Seek more effective methods for measuring progress<br />* And, most importantly, embrace change and use it to do something amazing","authors":{"author":{"id":"14556066","name":"George Couros","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1566258647p5/14556066.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1566258647p2/14556066.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14556066.George_Couros","average_rating":"4.23","ratings_count":"2125","text_reviews_count":"237"}},"published":"","work":{"id":"47315577","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.zQLRphBJszdD7SakpvAwdQ"}},{"id":{"_":"31423133","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":{"nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"_":"3259","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.J3tFY0tqSDsOwXd-XNCNZA","title":"Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World","title_without_series":"Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life...And Maybe the World","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1495769497l/31423133._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1495769497l/31423133._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31423133-make-your-bed","num_pages":"2","format":"Audiobook","edition_information":"","publisher":"Grand Central Publishing","publication_day":"4","publication_year":"2017","publication_month":"4","average_rating":"3.99","ratings_count":"65734","description":"Listening Length: 1 hour and 53 minutes<br /><br /><i><br />If you want to change the world, start off by making your bed.</i><br />On May 17, 2014, Admiral William H.

Relativity and quantum physics touch the very basis of physical reality, altering our commonsense notions of space and time, cause and effect. Both have reputations for complexity. But the basic ideas behind relativity and quantum physics are, in fact, simple and comprehensible by anyone. As Professor Wolfson points out, the essence of relativity can be summed up in a single sentence: The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion. The same goes for quantum theory, which is based on the principle that the \"stuff \" of the universe-matter and energy-is not infinitely divisible but comes in discrete chunks called \"quanta.\" <br /><br />Profound ... Beautiful ... Relevant <br /><br />Why should you care about these landmark theories? Because relativity and quantum physics are not only profound and beautiful ideas in their own right, they are also the gateway to understanding many of the latest science stories in the media. These are the stories about time travel, string theory, black holes, space telescopes, particle accelerators, and other cutting-edge developments. Consider these ideas: <br /><br />Although Einstein's theory of general relativity dates from 1914, it has not been possible to test certain predictions until recently. <br /><br />The Hubble Space Telescope is providing some of the most striking confirmations of the theory, including certain evidence for the existence of black holes, objects that warp space and time so that not even light can escape. <br /><br />Also, the expansion of the universe predicted by the theory of general relativity is now a known rate. General relativity also predicts an even weirder phenomenon called \"wormholes\" that offer shortcuts to remote reaches of time and space. <br /><br />According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, two twins would age at different rates if one left on a high-speed journey to a distant star and then returned. This experiment has actually been done, not with twins, but with an atomic clock flown around the world. <br /><br />Another fascinating experiment confirming that time slows as speed increases comes from measuring muons at the top and bottom of mountains.<br /><br /> A seemingly absurd consequence of quantum mechanics, called \"quantum tunneling,\" makes it possible for objects to materialize through impenetrable barriers. Quantum tunneling happens all the time on the subatomic scale and plays an important role in electronic devices and the nuclear processes that keep the sun shining. <br /><br />Some predictions about the expansion of the universe were so odd that Einstein himself tried to rewrite the mathematics in order to eliminate them. When Hubble discovered the expansion of the universe, Einstein called the revisions the biggest mistake he had ever made. <br /><br />An intriguing thought experiment called \"Schrödinger's cat\" suggests that a cat in an enclosed box is simultaneously alive and dead under experimental conditions involving quantum phenomena. <br /><br />From Aristotle to the Theory of Everything <br /><br />Professor Wolfson begins with a brief overview of theories of physical reality starting with Aristotle and culminating in Newtonian or \"classical\" physics. Then he outlines the logic that led to Einstein's theory of special relativity, and the simple yet far-reaching insight on which it rests. With that insight in mind, you move on to consider Einstein's theory of general relativity and its interpretation of gravitation in terms of the curvature of space and time. Professor Wolfson then shows how inquiry into matter at the atomic and subatomic scales led to quandaries that are resolved-or at least clarified-by quantum mechanics, a vision of physical reality so at odds with our experience that it nearly defies language. Bringing relativity and quantum mechanics into the same picture leads to hypotheses about the origin, development, and possible futures of the entire universe, and the possibility that physics can produce a \"theory of everything\" to account for all aspects of the physical world. <br /><br />Fascinating Incidents and Ideas <br /><br />Along the way, you'll explore these fascinating incidents and ideas: In the 1880s, Albert Michelson and Edward Morley conducted an experiment to determine the motion of the Earth relative to the ether, which was a supposedly imponderable substance pervading all of space. You'll learn about their experiment, its shocking result, and the resulting theoretical crisis. In 1905, a young Swiss patent clerk named Albert Einstein resolved the crisis by discarding the ether concept and asserting the principle of relativity-that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion. Relativity implies that the time order of events can be different in different reference frames. Does this wreak havoc with cause and effect? And why does Einstein assert that nothing can go faster than light? Shortly after publishing his 1905 paper on special relativity, Einstein realized that his theory required a fundamental equivalence between mass and energy, which he expressed in the equation E=mc2. Among other things, this famous formula means that the energy contained in a single raisin could power a large city for a whole day. Historically, the path to general relativity followed Einstein's attempt to incorporate gravity into relativity theory, which led to his understanding of gravity not as a force, but as a local manifestation of geometry in curved spacetime. Quantum theory places severe limits on our ability to observe nature at the atomic scale because it implies that the act of observation necessarily disturbs the thing that is being observed. The result is Werner Heisenberg's famous \"uncertainty principle.\" Are quarks, the particles that make up protons and neutrons, the truly elementary particles? What are the three fundamental forces that physicists identify as holding particles together? Could they be manifestations of a single, universal force? <br /><br />A Teaching Legend <br /><br />On his own Middlebury College campus, Professor Wolfson is a teaching legend with an infectious enthusiasm for his subject and a knack for conveying difficult concepts in a way that fosters true understanding. He is the author of an introductory text on physics, a contributor to the esteemed publication Scientific American, and a specialist in interpreting science for the nonspecialist. In this course, Professor Wolfson uses extensive illustrations and diagrams to help bring to life the theories and concepts that he discusses. Thus we highly recommend our DVD version, although Professor Wolfson is mindful of our audio students and carefully describes visual materials throughout his lectures. <br /><br />Professor Richard Wolfson on the Second Edition of Einstein's Relativity: <br /><br />\"The first version of this course was produced in 1995. In this new version, I have chosen to spend more time on the philosophical interpretation of quantum physics, and on recent experiments relevant to that interpretation. I have also added a final lecture on the theory of everything and its possible implementation through string theory.

Now it’s time for him to pay, and Wells has made it his personal mission. There are plenty of crosscurrents at work, though. The White House doesn’t want anybody stirring the pot; his old CIA bosses have their own agendas; other countries are starting to sniff around, sensing something unusual.

Kirsch, who was one of Langdon’s first students at Harvard two decades earlier, is about to reveal an astonishing breakthrough . . . one that will answer two of the fundamental questions of human existence. As the event begins, Langdon and several hundred guests find themselves captivated by an utterly original presentation, which Langdon realizes will be far more controversial than he ever imagined. But the meticulously orchestrated evening suddenly erupts into chaos, and Kirsch’s precious discovery teeters on the brink of being lost forever. Reeling and facing an imminent threat, Langdon is forced into a desperate bid to escape Bilbao. With him is Ambra Vidal, the elegant museum director who worked with Kirsch to stage the provocative event. Together they flee to Barcelona on a perilous quest to locate a cryptic password that will unlock Kirsch’s secret. Navigating the dark corridors of hidden history and extreme religion, Langdon and Vidal must evade a tormented enemy whose all-knowing power seems to emanate from Spain’s Royal Palace itself . . . and who will stop at nothing to silence Edmond Kirsch. On a trail marked by modern art and enigmatic symbols, Langdon and Vidal uncover clues that ultimately bring them face-to-face with Kirsch’s shocking discovery . . . and the breathtaking truth that has long eluded us. <i>Origin</i> is Dan Brown’s most brilliant and entertaining novel to date.","authors":{"author":{"id":"630","name":"Dan Brown","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399396714p5/630.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1399396714p2/630.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/630.Dan_Brown","average_rating":"3.84","ratings_count":"7159897","text_reviews_count":"185909"}},"published":"2017","work":{"id":"52935032","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.vWkDCg-hnt_kNH1wX90e7w"}},{"id":{"_":"3","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":{"nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"_":"82355","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tJT_00n8UPpvWa-zWHEAXg","title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)","title_without_series":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474154022l/3._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1474154022l/3._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone","num_pages":"309","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"Library Edition","publisher":"Scholastic Inc","publication_day":"1","publication_year":"2003","publication_month":"11","average_rating":"4.47","ratings_count":"7204603","description":"Harry Potter's life is miserable.

He adds detail and emotion about his youth in rural Georgia that he described in his magnificent <i>An Hour Before Daylight</i>. He writes about racism and the isolation of the Carters. He describes the brutality of the hazing regimen at Annapolis, and how he nearly lost his life twice serving on submarines and his amazing interview with Admiral Rickover. He describes the profound influence his mother had on him, and how he admired his father even though he didn't emulate him. He admits that he decided to quit the Navy and later enter politics without consulting his wife, Rosalynn, and how appalled he is in retrospect.<br /><br />In <i>A Full Life</i>, Carter tells what he is proud of and what he might do differently. He discusses his regret at losing his re-election, but how he and Rosalynn pushed on and made a new life and second and third rewarding careers. He is frank about the presidents who have succeeded him, world leaders, and his passions for the causes he cares most about, particularly the condition of women and the deprived people of the developing world.<br /><br />This is a wise and moving look back from this remarkable man.

Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.<br /><br />Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1439","name":"Malcolm Gladwell","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p5/1439.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p2/1439.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1439.Malcolm_Gladwell","average_rating":"4.01","ratings_count":"2182054","text_reviews_count":"85962"}},"published":"2002","work":{"id":"2124255","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.0gldOhtTZsFxGayFbXajCQ"}},{"id":{"_":"30900534","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0735222975","isbn13":"9780735222977","text_reviews_count":{"_":"1368","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.YtT2fL5--J1lXPI-mLXagA","title":"You Are a Badass at Making Money: Master the Mindset of Wealth","title_without_series":"You Are a Badass at Making Money: Master the Mindset of Wealth","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1518549912l/30900534._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1518549912l/30900534._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30900534-you-are-a-badass-at-making-money","num_pages":"267","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Viking","publication_day":"18","publication_year":"2017","publication_month":"4","average_rating":"3.96","ratings_count":"16845","description":"<b>“A cheerful manifesto on removing obstacles between yourself and the income of your dreams.” —<i>New York Magazine</i><br /><br />From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>You Are a Badass</i>, a life-changing guide to making the kind of money you’ve only ever dreamed of</b><br /><br /><i>You Are a Badass at Making Money</i> will launch you past the fears and stumbling blocks that have kept financial success beyond your reach.

Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at $9 billion, putting Holmes's worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn't work.<br /><br />For years, Holmes had been misleading investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. When Carreyrou, working at <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the <i>Journal</i> were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015. By early 2017, the company's value was zero and Holmes faced potential legal action from the government and her investors.

Why, despite the desperate need to address climate change, have even modest environmental efforts been defeated again and again? Why have protections for employees been decimated? Why do hedge-fund billionaires pay a far lower tax rate than middle-class workers?<br /><br />The conventional answer is that a popular uprising against “big government” led to the ascendancy of a broad-based conservative movement. But as Jane Mayer shows in this powerful, meticulously reported history, a network of exceedingly wealthy people with extreme libertarian views bankrolled a systematic, step-by-step plan to fundamentally alter the American political system.<br /><br />The network has brought together some of the richest people on the planet. Their core beliefs—that taxes are a form of tyranny; that government oversight of business is an assault on freedom—are sincerely held. But these beliefs also advance their personal and corporate interests: Many of their companies have run afoul of federal pollution, worker safety, securities, and tax laws.<br /><br />The chief figures in the network are Charles and David Koch, whose father made his fortune in part by building oil refineries in Stalin’s Russia and Hitler’s Germany. The patriarch later was a founding member of the John Birch Society, whose politics were so radical it believed Dwight Eisenhower was a communist. The brothers were schooled in a political philosophy that asserted the only role of government is to provide security and to enforce property rights.<br /><br />When libertarian ideas proved decidedly unpopular with voters, the Koch brothers and their allies chose another path. If they pooled their vast resources, they could fund an interlocking array of organizations that could work in tandem to influence and ultimately control academic institutions, think tanks, the courts, statehouses, Congress, and, they hoped, the presidency. Richard Mellon Scaife, the mercurial heir to banking and oil fortunes, had the brilliant insight that most of their political activities could be written off as tax-deductible “philanthropy.”<br /><br />These organizations were given innocuous names such as Americans for Prosperity. Funding sources were hidden whenever possible. This process reached its apotheosis with the allegedly populist Tea Party movement, abetted mightily by the <i>Citizens United</i> decision—a case conceived of by legal advocates funded by the network.<br /><br />The political operatives the network employs are disciplined, smart, and at times ruthless. Mayer documents instances in which people affiliated with these groups hired private detectives to impugn whistle-blowers, journalists, and even government investigators. And their efforts have been remarkably successful. Libertarian views on taxes and regulation, once far outside the mainstream and still rejected by most Americans, are ascendant in the majority of state governments, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Meaningful environmental, labor, finance, and tax reforms have been stymied.<br /><br />Jane Mayer spent five years conducting hundreds of interviews-including with several sources within the network-and scoured public records, private papers, and court proceedings in reporting this book. In a taut and utterly convincing narrative, she traces the byzantine trail of the billions of dollars spent by the network and provides vivid portraits of the colorful figures behind the new American oligarchy.<br /><br /><i>Dark Money</i> is a book that must be read by anyone who cares about the future of American democracy.","authors":{"author":{"id":"485392","name":"Jane Mayer","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1270092623p5/485392.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1270092623p2/485392.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/485392.Jane_Mayer","average_rating":"4.27","ratings_count":"25172","text_reviews_count":"3448"}},"published":"2016","work":{"id":"47815497","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.NBnHBkctYNXhrgdC0W8lmw"}},{"id":{"_":"35108805","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1250192455","isbn13":"9781250192455","text_reviews_count":{"_":"4177","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.nTWpnQJOmboEq79i7GNpyg","title":"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership","title_without_series":"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509630796l/35108805._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509630796l/35108805._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35108805-a-higher-loyalty","num_pages":"290","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"First Edition (U.S.)","publisher":"Flatiron Books","publication_day":"17","publication_year":"2018","publication_month":"4","average_rating":"4.07","ratings_count":"46036","description":"Former FBI Director James Comey shares his never-before-told experiences from some of the highest-stakes situations of his career in the past two decades of American government, exploring what good, ethical leadership looks like, and how it drives sound decisions.

He is a man who can count all his friends on the fingers of one hand, whose lifelong difficulty with social rituals has convinced him that he is simply not wired for romance.

One of America's most admired writers takes us on a mind-altering journey to the frontiers of human consciousness</b><br /><b></b><br /><b></b>When LSD was first discovered in the 1940s, it seemed to researchers, scientists and doctors as if the world might be on the cusp of psychological revolution. It promised to shed light on the deep mysteries of consciousness, as well as offer relief to addicts and the mentally ill. But in the 1960s, with the vicious backlash against the counter-culture, all further research was banned. In recent years, however, work has quietly begun again on the amazing potential of LSD, psilocybin and DMT. Could these drugs in fact improve the lives of many people? Diving deep into this extraordinary world and putting himself forward as a guinea-pig, Michael Pollan has written a remarkable history of psychedelics and a compelling portrait of the new generation of scientists fascinated by the implications of these drugs. <i>How to Change Your Mind</i> is a report from what could very well be the future of human consciousness.","authors":{"author":{"id":"2121","name":"Michael Pollan","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1366396171p5/2121.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1366396171p2/2121.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2121.Michael_Pollan","average_rating":"4.10","ratings_count":"482223","text_reviews_count":"37910"}},"published":"2018","work":{"id":"58370652","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.EOWVBKQmhqH05FYa8i0n7Q"}},{"id":{"_":"131262","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0307266125","isbn13":"9780307266125","text_reviews_count":{"_":"30","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.I3aKwjySjeQRSxpZKc5sGA","title":"All the Money in the World: How the Forbes 400 Make--and Spend--Their Fortunes","title_without_series":"All the Money in the World: How the Forbes 400 Make--and Spend--Their Fortunes","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320415412l/131262._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320415412l/131262._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131262.All_the_Money_in_the_World","num_pages":"384","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Knopf","publication_day":"4","publication_year":"2007","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"3.50","ratings_count":"209","description":"Published to coincide with the twenty-fifth anniversary of the<i> </i>Forbes 400, <i>All the Money in the World, </i>the work of a team of prominent editors and business writers, goes behind the celebrated list to paint a vivid and revealing portrait of the wealthiest Americans of the past quarter century.

That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1401","name":"Stephen Hawking","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1557493340p5/1401.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1557493340p2/1401.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1401.Stephen_Hawking","average_rating":"4.16","ratings_count":"573117","text_reviews_count":"22361"}},"published":"1998","work":{"id":"2192250","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.OZ8CGI8cStk8Z7Qkqcry1g"}},{"id":{"_":"13515711","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0316185361","isbn13":"9780316185363","text_reviews_count":{"_":"217","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.8G0g5MeeI9QMu2zjG__8ag","title":"Service: A Navy SEAL at War","title_without_series":"Service: A Navy SEAL at War","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334084570l/13515711._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334084570l/13515711._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13515711-service","num_pages":"384","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Little, Brown and Company","publication_day":"8","publication_year":"2012","publication_month":"5","average_rating":"4.30","ratings_count":"5798","description":"Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell returned from his star-crossed mission in Afghanistan with his bones shattered and his heart broken. So many had given their lives to save him-and he would have readily done the same for them. As he recuperated, he wondered why he and others, from America's founding to today, had been willing to sacrifice everything-including themselves-for the sake of family, nation, and freedom.<br /><br />In <em>Service</em>, we follow Marcus Luttrell to Iraq, where he returns to the battlefield as a member of SEAL Team 5 to help take on the most dangerous city in the world: Ramadi, the capital of war-torn Al Anbar Province. There, in six months of high-intensity urban combat, he would be part of what has been called the greatest victory in the history of U.S. Special Operations forces. We also return to Afghanistan and Operation Redwing, where Luttrell offers powerful new details about his miraculous rescue. Throughout, he reflects on what it really means to take on a higher calling, about the men he's seen lose their lives for their country, and the legacy of those who came and bled before.<br /><br />A thrilling war story, <em>Service</em> is also a profoundly moving tribute to the warrior brotherhood, to the belief that nobody goes it alone, and no one will be left behind.","authors":{"author":{"id":"379290","name":"Marcus Luttrell","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1336146198p5/379290.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1336146198p2/379290.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/379290.Marcus_Luttrell","average_rating":"4.31","ratings_count":"89453","text_reviews_count":"7466"}},"published":"2012","work":{"id":"19072323","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ARBb4mkMUn-R3TRKeiKoCw"}},{"id":{"_":"20608005","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1480586781","isbn13":"9781480586789","text_reviews_count":{"_":"24","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.nHa6-B2I0J9fygfkKkpg5g","title":"Driving Honda: Inside the World's Most Innovative Car Company","title_without_series":"Driving Honda: Inside the World's Most Innovative Car Company","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407166774l/20608005._SY160_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407166774l/20608005._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20608005-driving-honda","num_pages":"","format":"Audio CD","edition_information":"","publisher":"Brilliance Audio","publication_day":"31","publication_year":"2014","publication_month":"7","average_rating":"3.85","ratings_count":"269","description":"<blockquote>\n  <b>For decades there have been two iconic Japanese auto companies.

Now that the initial shock of the catastrophe is over, key Washington officials are up in arms over whether to make friends or foes of the agents who stepped between the enemy's bullets and countless American lives regardless of the legal consequences. Not for the first time, Rapp finds himself in the frustrating position of having to illustrate the realities of national security to politicians whose view from the sidelines is inevitably obstructed.<p>Meanwhile, three of the al Qaeda terrorists are still at large, and Rapp has been unofficially ordered to find them by any means necessary. No one knows the personal, physical, and emotional sacrifices required of the job better than Rapp. When he sees Nash cracking under the pressure of the mission and the memories of the horrors he witnessed during the terrorist attack, he makes a call he hopes will save his friend, assuage the naysayers on Capitol Hill, and get him one step closer to the enemy before it's too late.

An outraged Iranian government publicly blames both Israel and the United States for the attack and demands retribution. Privately, Iran's bombastic president wants much more. He wants America and Israel to pay for their aggression with blood.</p><p>Enter Mitch Rapp, America's top counterterrorism operative. Used to employing deception, Rapp sees an opportunity where others see only Iranian reprisals that could leave thousands of Americans dead. Rapp convinces President Josh Alexander to sign off on a risky operation that will further embarrass the Iranian government and push their country to the brink of revolution. As part of the plan, CIA director Irene Kennedy is dispatched to the region for a clandestine meeting with Azad Ashani, her Iranian counterpart.</p><p>But Rapp isn't the only one hatching plans. Iran's President Amatullah has recruited Hezbollah master terrorist Imad Mukhtar to do his dirty work. For decades Mukhtar has acted as a surrogate for Iran, blazing a trail of death and destruction across the Middle East and beyond. When Kennedy's meeting with Ashani goes disastrously wrong, Rapp and Mukhtar are set on a collision course that threatens to engulf the entire region in war. With the clock ticking, Rapp is given twenty-four hours, no questions asked, to do whatever it takes to stop Mukhtar, and avert an unthinkable catastrophe.</p>","authors":{"author":{"id":"14989","name":"Vince Flynn","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1360095804p5/14989.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1360095804p2/14989.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14989.Vince_Flynn","average_rating":"4.29","ratings_count":"711954","text_reviews_count":"24786"}},"published":"2007","work":{"id":"1206921","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.76gQtTMop_ONQ7yFL1ohtw"}},{"id":{"_":"26722","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0743270371","isbn13":"9780743270373","text_reviews_count":{"_":"893","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.hHQqXhdfbdKozbsOxXX3_Q","title":"Act of Treason (Mitch Rapp, #9)","title_without_series":"Act of Treason","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26722.Act_of_Treason","num_pages":"432","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Atria Books","publication_day":"10","publication_year":"2006","publication_month":"10","average_rating":"4.28","ratings_count":"46888","description":"<b>\n  <blockquote>CIA operative Mitch Rapp follows a trail of contract killers leading directly to the heart of our nation's capital in <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Vince Flynn's eighth explosive thriller.</blockquote>\n</b>It's a gorgeous autumn day in Georgetown.

A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.<br /><br />We all have a voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It’s a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it’s something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.<br /><br /><em>10% Happier</em> takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.","authors":{"author":{"id":"7890536","name":"Dan   Harris","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393858699p5/7890536.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393858699p2/7890536.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7890536.Dan_Harris","average_rating":"3.91","ratings_count":"88542","text_reviews_count":"6969"}},"published":"2014","work":{"id":"26365939","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.KgITrXPRw5QL4edgTJcW4w"}},{"id":{"_":"937249","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0671047345","isbn13":"9780671047344","text_reviews_count":{"_":"814","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.gkxCSI2dbm9U3_UD9lx2Pg","title":"Separation of Power (Mitch Rapp, #5)","title_without_series":"Separation of Power","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1314830847l/937249._SY160_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1314830847l/937249._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/937249.Separation_of_Power","num_pages":"448","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Pocket Books","publication_day":"27","publication_year":"2002","publication_month":"8","average_rating":"4.30","ratings_count":"44207","description":"<blockquote>\n  <b>CIA superagent Mitch Rapp is back in action in Vince Flynn's high-velocity <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.</b>\n</blockquote>Newly appointed CIA director Dr. Irene Kennedy is the target of an inside plot to destroy her and prematurely end the American President's term.

A group of terrorists has descended on the Executive Mansion, and gained access by means of a violent massacre that has left dozens of innocent bystanders murdered. Through the quick actions of the Secret Service, the president is evacuated to his underground bunker, but not before almost one hundred hostages are taken. <br /><br />While the politicians and the military leaders argue over how to negotiate with the terrorists, one man is sent in to break through the barrage of panicked responses and political agendas surrounding the chaotic crisis.

Moving stealthily among the corridors and secret passageways of the White House, stepping terrifyingly close to the enemy, Rapp scrambles to save the hostages before the terrorists can extract the president from the safety of his bunker. In a race against time, Rapp makes a chilling discovery that could rock Washington to its core: someone within his own government is maneuvering in hopes that his rescue attempt will fail.","authors":{"author":{"id":"14989","name":"Vince Flynn","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1360095804p5/14989.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1360095804p2/14989.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14989.Vince_Flynn","average_rating":"4.29","ratings_count":"711954","text_reviews_count":"24786"}},"published":"2005","work":{"id":"2127844","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.vwfF2GkNhG4gspYeuAfffQ"}},{"id":{"_":"10816297","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1416595201","isbn13":"9781416595205","text_reviews_count":{"_":"1774","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.6MPr3LP7GD7TI7jUSSKloA","title":"Kill Shot (Mitch Rapp, #2)","title_without_series":"Kill Shot","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10816297-kill-shot","num_pages":"385","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Emily Bestler Atria Simon & Schuster","publication_day":"7","publication_year":"2012","publication_month":"2","average_rating":"4.30","ratings_count":"44688","description":"<b>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>American Assassin</i>—now a major motion picture</b><br /><br /><b>Vince Flynn’s intensely suspenseful #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller puts the young, hungry, and lethal superagent of <i>American Assassin </i>in the crosshairs even as he kills with impunity.</b><br /><br />In the year since the CIA trained and then unleashed him, Mitch Rapp has dismantled, kill by untraceable kill, the network of monsters behind the Pan Am Lockerbie terrorist attack.

Mitch Rapp's cover has been blown. After leading a team of commandos deep into Iraq to prevent Saddam Hussein from joining the nuclear arms race, he was publicly hailed by the president as the single most important person in the fight against terrorism. But after years of working covertly behind the scenes, Rapp now lives in the glare of the public spotlight, lauded by the nation and an easy target for virtually every terrorist from Jakarta to London.<br /><br />As special advisor on counterterrorism to CIA director Dr. Irene Kennedy, Rapp is ready to fight the war on terrorism from CIA headquarters rather than the front line. That is, until a platoon of Navy SEALs, sent to the Philippines to save an American family kidnapped by radical Islamic terrorists, is caught in a deadly ambush.

Joe Rickman wasn’t just another foot soldier. For the last eight years Rickman had ran the CIA’s clandestine operations in Afghanistan. It was a murky job that involved working with virtually every disreputable figure in the Islamic Republic. More than a quarter billion dollars in cash had passed through Rickman’s hands during his tenure as the master of black ops and no one with a shred of sense wanted to know the details of how that money had been spent.<br /><br />At first glance it looks as if Rickman has been kidnapped, but Rapp knows certain things about his old friend that cause him to wonder if something more disturbing isn’t afoot.

Spurred by a public outcry, the federal government launched an epic two-year manhunt for the site’s elusive proprietor, with no leads, no witnesses, and no clear jurisdiction. All the investigators knew was that whoever was running the site called himself the Dread Pirate Roberts.<br /> <br />The Silk Road quickly ballooned into $1.2 billion enterprise, and Ross embraced his new role as kingpin. He enlisted a loyal crew of allies in high and low places, all as addicted to the danger and thrill of running an illegal marketplace as their customers were to the heroin they sold. Through his network he got wind of the target on his back and took drastic steps to protect himself—including ordering a hit on a former employee. As Ross made plans to disappear forever, the Feds raced against the clock to catch a man they weren’t sure even existed, searching for a needle in the haystack of the global Internet.<br /><br />Drawing on exclusive access to key players and two billion digital words and images Ross left behind, <i>Vanity Fair</i> correspondent and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Nick Bilton offers a tale filled with twists and turns, lucky breaks and unbelievable close calls. It’s a story of the boy next door’s ambition gone criminal, spurred on by the clash between the new world of libertarian-leaning, anonymous, decentralized Web advocates and the old world of government control, order, and the rule of law. Filled with unforgettable characters and capped by an astonishing climax, <i>American Kingpin</i> might be dismissed as too outrageous for fiction. But it’s all too real.","authors":{"author":{"id":"3164188","name":"Nick Bilton","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1384455454p5/3164188.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1384455454p2/3164188.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3164188.Nick_Bilton","average_rating":"4.22","ratings_count":"40954","text_reviews_count":"3204"}},"published":"","work":{"id":"52573415","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.fZW1ibxN8EsLI51jYhsyjQ"}},{"id":{"_":"33585396","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1524758841","isbn13":"9781524758844","text_reviews_count":{"_":"225","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.CvZdHpGtB_EecPx3xM6--g","title":"Side Hustle: From Idea to Income in 27 Days","title_without_series":"Side Hustle: From Idea to Income in 27 Days","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498835207l/33585396._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498835207l/33585396._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33585396-side-hustle","num_pages":"272","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Currency","publication_day":"19","publication_year":"2017","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"3.77","ratings_count":"2961","description":"<b>The author of the New York Times Bestseller THE $100 STARTUP shows how to launch a profitable side hustle in just 27 days.</b><br /><br /><br />For some people, the thought of quitting their day job to pursue the entrepreneurial life is exhilarating. For many others, it's terrifying. After all, a stable job that delivers a regular paycheck is a blessing. And not everyone has the means or the desire to take on the risks and responsibilities of working for themselves.<br /><br />But what if we could quickly and easily create an additional stream of income without giving up the security of a full-time job? Enter the side hustle.<br /><br />Chris Gullibeau is no stranger to this world, having launched more than a dozen side hustles over his career. Here, he offers a step-by-step guide that takes you from idea to income in just 27 days.<br /><br />Designed for the busy and impatient, this detailed roadmap will show you how to select, launch, refine, and make money from your side hustle in under a month. You'll learn how to:<br /><br />- Brainstorm, borrow, and steal to build an arsenal of great side hustle ideas (day 3)<br /> - Apply \"Tinder for Side Hustle\" logic to pick the best idea at any time (day 6)<br /> - Learn, gather, or create everything you need to launch; then set up a real life way to get paid (days 13-14)<br /> - Start raking in the money by channeling your inner Girl Scout (day 18)<br /> - Master the art of deals, discounts, and special offers (day 21)<br /> - Raise your game: improve, expand, or make more money off your hustle (days 24-26)<br /><br />A side hustle is more than just another stream of income, it's also the new job security. When you receive paychecks from different sources, it allows you to take more chances in your \"regular\" career. More income means more options. More options equals freedom. You don't need entrepreneurial experience to launch a profitable side hustle. You don't have to have an MBA, or know how to code, or be an expert marketer. You don't need employees or investors. With Chris as a guide, anyone can make more money, pursue a passion, and enjoy greater security - without quitting their day job.","authors":{"author":{"id":"3367145","name":"Chris Guillebeau","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1372087146p5/3367145.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1372087146p2/3367145.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3367145.Chris_Guillebeau","average_rating":"3.84","ratings_count":"74826","text_reviews_count":"3759"}},"published":"2017","work":{"id":"54398637","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.fCrkQ3qAaaJGELvmHMJU_A"}},{"id":{"_":"26109393","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0525955054","isbn13":"9780525955054","text_reviews_count":{"_":"348","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.JwOnjXhIxAa_C66KZh3XVA","title":"Red Platoon: A True Story of American Valor","title_without_series":"Red Platoon: A True Story of American Valor","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1457890793l/26109393._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1457890793l/26109393._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26109393-red-platoon","num_pages":"378","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Dutton","publication_day":"3","publication_year":"2016","publication_month":"5","average_rating":"4.57","ratings_count":"4905","description":"<b>The only comprehensive, firsthand account of the thirteen hour firefight at the Battle of Keating by Medal of Honor recipient Clinton Romesha, for readers of <i>Black Hawk Down </i>by Mark Bowden and <i>Lone Survivor</i> by Marcus Luttrell</b><br />  <br /> \"'It doesn't get better.' To us, that phrase nailed one of the essential truths, maybe even the essential truth, about being stuck at an outpost whose strategic and tactical vulnerabilities were so glaringly obvious to every soldier who had ever set foot in that place that the name itself -- Keating -- had become a kind of backhanded joke.\"<br />  <br />In 2009, Clinton Romesha of Red Platoon and the rest of the Black Knight Troop were preparing to shut down Command Outpost Keating, the most remote and inaccessible in a string of bases built by the U.S. military in Nuristan and Kunar in the hope of preventing Taliban insurgents from moving freely back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Three years after its construction, the army was finally ready to concede what the men on the ground had known immediately: it was simply too isolated and too dangerous to defend. <br />  <br /> On October 3, 2009, after years of constant smaller attacks, the Taliban finally decided to throw everything they had at Keating.

Part 1 is about the purpose and importance of having principles in general, having nothing to do with mine. Part 2 explains my most fundamental life principles that apply to everything I do. Part 3, explains my management principles as they are being lived out at Bridgewater. Since my management principles are simply my most fundamental life principles applied to management, reading Part 2 will help you to better understand Part 3, but it’s not required—you can go directly to Part 3 to see what my management principles are and how Bridgewater has been run. One day I’d like to write a Part 4 on my investment principles. If you are looking to get the most bang for your buck (i.e., understanding for the effort), I suggest that you read Parts 1 and 2, and the beginning of Part 3 (through the Summary and Table of Principles) which will give you nearly the whole picture. It’s only about 55 pages of a normal size book. <br /><br />Above all else, I want you to think for yourself—to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true and 3) what to do about it. I want you to do that in a clear-headed thoughtful way, so that you get what you want. I wrote this book to help you do that. I am going to ask only two things of you—1) that you be open-minded and 2) that you honestly answer some questions about what you want, what is true and what you want to do about it. If you do these things, I believe that you will get a lot out of this book. If you can’t do these things, you should reflect on why that is, because you probably have discovered one of your greatest impediments to getting what you want out of life.","authors":{"author":{"id":"5289593","name":"Ray Dalio","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1505763841p5/5289593.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1505763841p2/5289593.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5289593.Ray_Dalio","average_rating":"4.13","ratings_count":"43134","text_reviews_count":"2929"}},"published":"2011","work":{"id":"18091113","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.TA2IqZJdoAtSQldNuACc-w"}},{"id":{"_":"28257707","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":{"nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"_":"26569","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.ysvaV5CVuyQiR6PtHSekJw","title":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life","title_without_series":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465761302l/28257707._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465761302l/28257707._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck","num_pages":"224","format":"ebook","edition_information":"","publisher":"Harper","publication_day":"13","publication_year":"2016","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"3.94","ratings_count":"556861","description":"<i>Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780062457738</i><br /><br />In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be \"positive\" all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.<br /><br />For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. <em>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k</em> is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.<br /><br />Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek.<br /><br />There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience.

My qualification is not that I am better than you but I am worse.\" (Russell Brand)<br /><br />With a rare mix of honesty, humor, and compassion, comedian and movie star Russell Brand mines his own wild story and shares the advice and wisdom he has gained through his 14 years of recovery. Brand speaks to those suffering along the full spectrum of addiction - from drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar addictions to addictions to work, stress, bad relationships, digital media, and fame. Brand understands that addiction can take many shapes and sizes and how the process of staying clean, sane, and unhooked is a daily activity. He believes that the question is not \"why are you addicted?\" but \"what pain is your addiction masking? Why are you running - into the wrong job, the wrong life, the wrong person's arms?\"<br /><br />Russell has been in all the 12-step fellowships going, he's started his own men's group, he's a therapy regular and a practiced yogi - and while he's worked on this material as part of his comedy and previous best sellers, he's never before shared the tools that really took him out of it, that keep him clean and clear. Here he provides not only a recovery plan but an attempt to make sense of the ailing world.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.","authors":{"author":{"id":"884168","name":"Russell Brand","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1429657779p5/884168.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1429657779p2/884168.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/884168.Russell_Brand","average_rating":"3.59","ratings_count":"47838","text_reviews_count":"3956"}},"published":"2017","work":{"id":"54902568","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.hfGySWdkUY7dmkRi8DPdWQ"}},{"id":{"_":"16130079","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1476727953","isbn13":"9781476727950","text_reviews_count":{"_":"16","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.Rm76N3qQYBPGdbiQ773htw","title":"Enemies Within: Inside the NYPD's Secret Spying Unit and bin Laden's Final Plot Against America","title_without_series":"Enemies Within: Inside the NYPD's Secret Spying Unit and bin Laden's Final Plot Against America","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410978209l/16130079._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410978209l/16130079._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130079-enemies-within","num_pages":"336","format":"ebook","edition_information":"","publisher":"Atria Books","publication_day":"3","publication_year":"2013","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"3.87","ratings_count":"251","description":"Two Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists take an unbridled look into one of the most sensitive post-9/11 national security investigations—a breathtaking race to stop a second devastating terrorist attack on American soil.<br /><br />In <i>Enemies Within</i>, Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman “reveal how New York really works” (James Risen, author of <i>State of War</i>) and lay bare the complex and often contradictory state of counterterrorism and intelligence in America through the pursuit of Najibullah Zazi, a terrorist bomber who trained under one of bin Laden’s most trusted deputies. Zazi and his co-conspirators represented America’s greatest fear: a terrorist cell operating inside America.<br /><br />This real-life spy story—uncovered in previously unpublished secret NYPD documents and interviews with intelligence sources—shows that while many of our counterterrorism programs are more invasive than ever, they are often counterproductive at best.<br /><br />After 9/11, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly initiated an audacious plan for the Big Apple: dispatch a vast network of plainclothes officers and paid informants—called “rakers” and “mosque crawlers”—into Muslim neighborhoods to infiltrate religious communities and eavesdrop on college campuses. Police amassed data on innocent people, often for their religious and political beliefs. But when it mattered most, these strategies failed to identify the most imminent threats.<br /><br />In <i>Enemies Within</i>, Appuzo and Goldman tackle the tough questions about the measures that we take to protect ourselves from real and perceived threats. They take you inside America’s sprawling counterterrorism machine while it operates at full throttle. They reveal what works, what doesn’t, and what Americans have unknowingly given up. “Did the Snowden leaks trouble you?

How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? <br /><br />In <i>Sapiens</i>, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors?

The disintegration of this group, a process that has been slowly occurring now for more than forty years, has been reported with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.<br /><br />The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.’s grandparents were “dirt poor and in love,” and moved north from Kentucky’s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually one of their grandchildren would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of success in achieving generational upward mobility. But as the family saga of <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> plays out, we learn that J.D.'s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, never fully escaping the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. With piercing honesty, Vance shows how he himself still carries around the demons of his chaotic family history.<br /><br />A deeply moving memoir, with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures, <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.","authors":{"author":{"id":"15109469","name":"J.D.

As this question fills the airwaves with anticipation, their legions of fans continue to multiply and ask a different series of questions, like—Who are these people?What’s the secret to their success?

However, their paths did not cross until Chip checked his car into the local Firestone tire shop where Joanna worked behind the counter. Even back then Chip was a serial entrepreneur who, among other things, ran a lawn care company, sold fireworks, and flipped houses. Soon they were married and living in their first fixer upper.

He enlists Jake on an insane—and insanely possible—mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jake’s life—a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.","authors":{"author":{"id":"3389","name":"Stephen King","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p5/3389.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1362814142p2/3389.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King","average_rating":"4.04","ratings_count":"14959547","text_reviews_count":"598599"}},"published":"2011","work":{"id":"15553789","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.HtVBAIPUEpTEm1NjPTSEyg"}},{"id":{"_":"27274421","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1476778965","isbn13":"9781476778969","text_reviews_count":{"_":"57","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.d7F1XNEby0p320K6PY18Zg","title":"Valley of the Gods: A Silicon Valley Story","title_without_series":"Valley of the Gods: A Silicon Valley Story","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1450632287l/27274421._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1450632287l/27274421._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27274421-valley-of-the-gods","num_pages":"272","format":"ebook","edition_information":"","publisher":"Simon  Schuster","publication_day":"10","publication_year":"2017","publication_month":"1","average_rating":"2.88","ratings_count":"471","description":"Reporter Alexandra Wolfe’s biting but admiring story of Silicon Valley, and the men and women whose hubris and ambition are changing the world.<br /><br />Each year, young people from around the world go to Silicon Valley to hatch an idea, start a company, strike it rich, and become powerful and famous. In “a jauntily paced anthropological look at Northern California’s techtopia” (<i>Bloomberg Businessweek</i>), reporter and columnist for <i>The Wall Street Journal </i>Alexandra Wolfe follows three of these upstarts who have “stopped out” of college and real life in the hopes of becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk.<br /> <br />Meet the billionaires who go to training clubs for thirty-minute “body slams” designed to fit in with the start-up schedule; attend parties where people devour peanut butter-and-jelly sushi rolls; and date and seduce in a romantic culture in which thick glasses, baggy jeans, and a t-shirt is the costume of any sex symbol (and where a jacket and tie symbolize mediocrity). Through Wolfe’s eyes, we discover how they date and marry, how they dress and live, how they plot and dream, and how they have created a business world and an economic order that has made us all devotees of them.<br /> <br />In her blistering and hysterical examination of this new ruling class<i>, </i>Wolfe “offers a revealing peek inside the privilege, power, and profligacy of Silicon Valley” (<i>Town &amp; Country</i>). <i>Valley of the Gods</i> “captures the absurdity of this brave new world, pierces the hype, but also conveys the dreams and the passions that can shape a world’s economy” (<i>USA TODAY</i>).","authors":{"author":{"id":"6544121","name":"Alexandra Wolfe","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1349117732p5/6544121.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1349117732p2/6544121.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6544121.Alexandra_Wolfe","average_rating":"2.88","ratings_count":"472","text_reviews_count":"75"}},"published":"2017","work":{"id":"47328250","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.DdfIKUqpE-YZM5Cq8CJFbA"}},{"id":{"_":"29868610","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1501117203","isbn13":"9781501117206","text_reviews_count":{"_":"6915","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.SYBiIF4CB_dwXUbsbh5qrA","title":"Scrappy Little Nobody","title_without_series":"Scrappy Little Nobody","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469410391l/29868610._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469410391l/29868610._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29868610-scrappy-little-nobody","num_pages":"275","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Gallery Books","publication_day":"15","publication_year":"2016","publication_month":"11","average_rating":"3.87","ratings_count":"79633","description":"A collection of humorous autobiographical essays by the Academy Award-nominated actress and star of <i>Up in the Air</i> and <i>Pitch Perfect</i>.<br /><br />Even before she made a name for herself on the silver screen starring in films like <i>Pitch Perfect</i>, <i>Up in the Air</i>, <i>Twilight</i>, and <i>Into the Woods</i>, Anna Kendrick was unusually small, weird, and “10 percent defiant.”<br /><br />At the ripe age of thirteen, she had already resolved to “keep the crazy inside my head where it belonged.

If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: Happiness <i>fuels </i>success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, resilient, and productive at work. This isn’t just an empty mantra. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigorous research in psychology and neuroscience, management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe. <br />            <br />In <i>The Happiness Advantage</i>, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own research—including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS and KPMG—to fix this broken formula. Using stories and case studies from his work with thousands of Fortune 500 executives in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive edge at work. <br />            <br />Isolating seven practical, actionable principles that have been tried and tested everywhere from classrooms to boardrooms, stretching from Argentina to Zimbabwe, he shows us how we can capitalize on the Happiness Advantage to improve our performance and maximize our potential. Among the principles he outlines: <br /> <br /><br />    • The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can see—and seize—opportunities wherever we look.<br />    • The Zorro Circle: how to channel our efforts on small, manageable goals, to gain the leverage to gradually conquer bigger and bigger ones.<br />    • Social Investment: how to reap the dividends of investing in one of the greatest predictors of success and happiness—our social support network<br /><br />  <br />A must-read for everyone trying to excel in a world of increasing workloads, stress, and negativity, <i>The Happiness Advantage </i>isn’t only about how to become happier at work. It’s about how to reap the benefits of a happier and more positive mind-set to achieve the extraordinary in our work and in our lives.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>","authors":{"author":{"id":"4024160","name":"Shawn Achor","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1426441397p5/4024160.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1426441397p2/4024160.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4024160.Shawn_Achor","average_rating":"4.16","ratings_count":"30723","text_reviews_count":"2559"}},"published":"2010","work":{"id":"14369512","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.uxyBMQ2-N4BEzJNWEaB7Tg"}},{"id":{"_":"27416150","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1484775848","isbn13":"9781484775844","text_reviews_count":{"_":"53","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.8-_DwZxoQ087-BCKef1jgw","title":"The Force Awakens - A Junior Novel","title_without_series":"The Force Awakens - A Junior Novel","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1454294647l/27416150._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1454294647l/27416150._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27416150-the-force-awakens---a-junior-novel","num_pages":"192","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Disney Lucasfilm Press","publication_day":"16","publication_year":"2016","publication_month":"2","average_rating":"3.92","ratings_count":"588","description":"Relive the excitement of one of the most anticipated movies of all time with this action-packed retelling of <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>!

No. Media appearances? No. And to an introvert like Shonda, who describes herself as 'hugging the walls' at social events and experiencing panic attacks before press interviews, there was a particular benefit to saying no: nothing new to fear. Then came Thanksgiving 2013, when Shonda's sister Delorse muttered six little words at her: You never say yes to anything. Profound, impassioned and laugh-out-loud funny, in Year of Yes Shonda Rhimes reveals how saying YES changed - and saved - her life.

Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments.<br /><br />Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius, but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own character lab and set out to test her theory.<br /><br />Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers; from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of <i>The New Yorker</i> to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.<br /><br />Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, <i>Grit</i> is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that not talent or luck makes all the difference.","authors":{"author":{"id":"14132767","name":"Angela Duckworth","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1461691947p5/14132767.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1461691947p2/14132767.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14132767.Angela_Duckworth","average_rating":"4.08","ratings_count":"72639","text_reviews_count":"5681"}},"published":"2016","work":{"id":"45670634","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.9G7lJooEl8Kowf9AOMimsg"}},{"id":{"_":"18053732","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":"9781939293107","text_reviews_count":{"_":"103","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.rLnVp-cr3GuDhiajUfWSYA","title":"Autopilot: The Art & Science of Doing Nothing","title_without_series":"Autopilot: The Art & Science of Doing Nothing","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1399494666l/18053732._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1399494666l/18053732._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18053732-autopilot","num_pages":"148","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"OR Books ","publication_day":"","publication_year":"2013","publication_month":"7","average_rating":"3.47","ratings_count":"806","description":"\"Andrew Smart wants you to sit and do nothing much more often – and he has the science to explain why.<br /><br />At every turn we’re pushed to do more, faster and more efficiently: that drumbeat resounds throughout our wage-slave society. Multitasking is not only a virtue, it’s a necessity. Books such as Getting Things Done, The One Minute Manager, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People regularly top the bestseller lists, and have spawned a considerable industry.<br /><br />But Andrew Smart argues that slackers may have the last laugh.

Now, we meet the actor who is every bit as loveable as the character he plays on TV. In this revealing collection of essays written in his irreverent, hilarious, and self-deprecating voice, Kunal Nayyar traces his journey from a little boy in New Delhi who mistakes an awkward first kiss for a sacred commitment, gets nosebleeds chugging Coca-Cola to impress other students, and excels in the sport of badminton, to the confident, successful actor on the set of TV’s most-watched sitcom since <i>Friends</i>.<br /><br />Going behind the scenes of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> and into his personal experiences, Kunal introduces readers to the people who helped him grow, such as his James Bond-loving, mustachioed father who taught him the most important lessons in life: <i>Treat a beggar as you would a king. There are two sides to every story. A smile goes a long way. And, when in doubt, use a spreadsheet.</i> Kunal also walks us through his college years in Portland, where he takes his first sips of alcohol and learns to let loose with his French, 6’8” gentle-giant roommate, works his first-ever job for the university’s housekeeping department cleaning toilets for minimum wage, and begins a series of romantic exploits that go just about as well as they would for Raj. (That is, until he meets and marries a former Miss India in an elaborate seven-day event that we get to experience in a chapter titled “My Big Fat Indian Wedding.”)<br /><br />Full of heart, but never taking itself too seriously, this witty and often inspiring collection of underdog tales follows a young man as he traverses two continents in search of a dream, along the way transcending culture and language (and many, many embarrassing incidents) to somehow miraculously land the role of a lifetime.","authors":{"author":{"id":"9824956","name":"Kunal Nayyar","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9824956.Kunal_Nayyar","average_rating":"3.75","ratings_count":"7312","text_reviews_count":"1057"}},"published":"2015","work":{"id":"43082864","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.DfGEUJSWH-HCdGtSPy9x_g"}},{"id":{"_":"711901","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0316067598","isbn13":"9780316067591","text_reviews_count":{"_":"5799","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.cczby1Uak1gb-ofSpFQbKQ","title":"Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10","title_without_series":"Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344265535l/711901._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344265535l/711901._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/711901.Lone_Survivor","num_pages":"390","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Little, Brown and Company","publication_day":"12","publication_year":"2007","publication_month":"6","average_rating":"4.32","ratings_count":"78063","description":"On a clear night in late June 2005, four U.S. Navy SEALs left their base in northern Afghanistan for the mountainous Pakistani border. Their mission was to capture or kill a notorious al Qaeda leader known to be ensconced in a Taliban stronghold surrounded by a small but heavily armed force. Less then twenty-four hours later, only one of those Navy SEALs remained alive. <br /><br /><br /> This is the story of fire team leader Marcus Luttrell, the sole survivor of Operation Redwing, and the desperate battle in the mountains that led, ultimately, to the largest loss of life in Navy SEAL history. But it is also, more than anything, the story of his teammates, who fought ferociously beside him until he was the last one left-blasted unconscious by a rocket grenade, blown over a cliff, but still armed and still breathing. Over the next four days, badly injured and presumed dead, Luttrell fought off six al Qaeda assassins who were sent to finish him, then crawled for seven miles through the mountains before he was taken in by a Pashtun tribe, who risked everything to protect him from the encircling Taliban killers.<br /><br /><br /> A six-foot-five-inch Texan, Leading Petty Officer Luttrell takes us, blow-by-blow, through the brutal training of America's warrior elite and the relentless rites of passage required by the Navy SEALs. He transports us to a monstrous battle fought in the desolate peaks of Afghanistan, where the beleaguered American team plummeted headlong a thousand feet down a mountain as they fought back through flying shale and rocks. In this rich , moving chronicle of courage, honor, and patriotism, Marcus Luttrell delivers one of the most powerful narratives ever written about modern warfare-and a tribute to his teammates, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.","authors":{"author":{"id":"379290","name":"Marcus Luttrell","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1336146198p5/379290.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1336146198p2/379290.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/379290.Marcus_Luttrell","average_rating":"4.31","ratings_count":"89453","text_reviews_count":"7466"}},"published":"2007","work":{"id":"1623890","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.HQw2ehHBLmvb1xwu5ADitQ"}},{"id":{"_":"11230081","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0446585025","isbn13":"9780446585026","text_reviews_count":{"_":"6513","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.-WuQfWDrwz0XGlp8smObFA","title":"Seriously...

In 2006, Parnell and his 10th Mountain Division platoon, the self-styled Outlaws, arrived in Afghanistan’s Bermel Valley, which borders Pakistan. Their mission was “to stanch the flow of enemy troops and supplies into Afghanistan.” Besides their 32 Purple Hearts, the platoon—which “usually patrolled with about 30 men... loaded into six Humvees”—earned seven Bronze Stars and 12 Army Commendations for Valor, making it one of the most decorated units in the Afghan war. Parnell vividly captures the sounds, sights, and smells of combat, and proves most eloquent when describing the bond—“selflessness was our secret weapon”—that developed among his men. Studiously nonpartisan, Parnell still raises important questions about Afghan president Hamid Karzai’s integrity, the competence of the Afghan police, and the sincerity of our Pakistani “allies.” Parnell balances sentimentality with sincerity and crisp prose to produce one of the Afghan war’s most moving combat narratives.","authors":{"author":{"id":"18403430","name":"Sean  Parnell","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1536597882p5/18403430.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1536597882p2/18403430.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18403430.Sean_Parnell","average_rating":"4.33","ratings_count":"11109","text_reviews_count":"976"}},"published":"2012","work":{"id":"18150348","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mkB6AvynR2Olhh8rNLJZqA"}},{"id":{"_":"13153198","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0812993403","isbn13":"9780812993400","text_reviews_count":{"_":"268","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.iImeNrbA6SjqWi0GCPzV6g","title":"Into the Fire: A Firsthand Account of the Most Extraordinary Battle in the Afghan War","title_without_series":"Into the Fire: A Firsthand Account of the Most Extraordinary Battle in the Afghan War","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1359617446l/13153198._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1359617446l/13153198._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13153198-into-the-fire","num_pages":"336","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"First Edition","publisher":"Random House, Inc.","publication_day":"25","publication_year":"2012","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"4.15","ratings_count":"4094","description":"<b>“The story of what Dakota did . . . will be told for generations.” — President Barack Obama, from remarks given at Meyer’s Medal of Honor ceremony.</b><br /><br />In the fall of 2009, Taliban insurgents ambushed a patrol of Afghan soldiers and Marine advisors in a mountain village called Ganjigal. Firing from entrenched positions, the enemy was positioned to wipe out one hundred men who were pinned down and were repeatedly refused artillery support. Ordered to remain behind with the vehicles, twenty-one year-old Marine corporal Dakota Meyer disobeyed orders and attacked to rescue his comrades.<br /> <br />With a brave driver at the wheel, Meyer stood in the gun turret exposed to withering fire, rallying Afghan troops to follow. Over the course of the five hours, he charged into the valley time and again. Employing a variety of machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, and even a rock, Meyer repeatedly repulsed enemy attackers, carried wounded Afghan soldiers to safety, and provided cover for dozens of others to escape—supreme acts of valor and determination. In the end, Meyer and four stalwart comrades—an Army captain, an Afghan sergeant major, and two Marines—cleared the battlefield and came to grips with a tragedy they knew could have been avoided. For his actions on that day, Meyer became the first living Marine in three decades to be awarded the Medal of Honor.<br /> <br /><i>Into the Fire</i> tells the full story of the chaotic battle of Ganjigal for the first time, in a compelling, human way that reveals it as a microcosm of our recent wars. Meyer takes us from his upbringing on a farm in Kentucky, through his Marine and sniper training, onto the battlefield, and into the vexed aftermath of his harrowing exploits in a battle that has become the stuff of legend. <br /> <br />Investigations ensued, even as he was pitched back into battle alongside U.S. Army soldiers who embraced him as a fellow grunt. When it was over, he returned to the States to confront living with the loss of his closest friends.

The Pentagon has officially confirmed more than 150 of Kyle's kills (the previous American record was 109), but it has declined to verify the astonishing total number for this book. Iraqi insurgents feared Kyle so much they named him al-Shaitan (“the devil”) and placed a bounty on his head. Kyle earned legendary status among his fellow SEALs, Marines, and U.S. Army soldiers, whom he protected with deadly accuracy from rooftops and stealth positions. Gripping and unforgettable, Kyle’s masterful account of his extraordinary battlefield experiences ranks as one of the great war memoirs of all time.<br /><br />A native Texan who learned to shoot on childhood hunting trips with his father, Kyle was a champion saddle-bronc rider prior to joining the Navy. After 9/11, he was thrust onto the front lines of the War on Terror, and soon found his calling as a world-class sniper who performed best under fire. He recorded a personal-record 2,100-yard kill shot outside Baghdad; in Fallujah, Kyle braved heavy fire to rescue a group of Marines trapped on a street; in Ramadi, he stared down insurgents with his pistol in close combat. Kyle talks honestly about the pain of war—of twice being shot and experiencing the tragic deaths of two close friends.<br /><br />American Sniper also honors Kyles fellow warriors, who raised hell on and off the battlefield. And in moving first-person accounts throughout, Kyles wife, Taya, speaks openly about the strains of war on their marriage and children, as well as on Chris.<br /><br />Adrenaline-charged and deeply personal, American Sniper is a thrilling eyewitness account of war that only one man could tell.","authors":{"author":{"id":"2728589","name":"Chris Kyle","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1597472084p5/2728589.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1597472084p2/2728589.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2728589.Chris_Kyle","average_rating":"4.00","ratings_count":"116569","text_reviews_count":"8460"}},"published":"2012","work":{"id":"16845778","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.IJpFdG7tT5Ug4rZ6m14b9Q"}},{"id":{"_":"21853661","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1250045444","isbn13":"9781250045447","text_reviews_count":{"_":"190","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.vDbo83pUB25E8dL6qBYjsA","title":"The Reaper: Autobiography of One of the Deadliest Special Ops Snipers","title_without_series":"The Reaper: Autobiography of One of the Deadliest Special Ops Snipers","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403429705l/21853661._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403429705l/21853661._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21853661-the-reaper","num_pages":"320","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"St. Martin's Press","publication_day":"27","publication_year":"2015","publication_month":"1","average_rating":"4.12","ratings_count":"3191","description":"Groundbreaking, thrilling and revealing, The Reaper is the astonishing memoir of Special Operations Direct Action Sniper Nicholas Irving, the 3rd Ranger Battalion's deadliest sniper with 33 confirmed kills, though his remarkable career total, including probables, is unknown.<br /><br />In the bestselling tradition of American Sniper and Shooter, Irving shares the true story of his extraordinary career, including his deployment to Afghanistan in the summer of 2009, when he set another record, this time for enemy kills on a single deployment.

This is a fascinating tale-and potentially the first-to describe the work of American contractors, men who run highly dangerous missions deep inside foreign countries on the brink of war. It will lift the veil and detail the ultimate danger and risk of paramilitary operations (both officially government-sanctioned and not) and show us in very intimate terms exactly what private soldiers do when the government can't act or take public responsibility. GRAY WORK combines covert military intelligence with boots-on-the-ground realism, following Jamie Smith through his CIA training and work as a spy in the State Department, to his co-founding of Blackwater following 9/11, to his decision to leave that company. As the founder and director of Blackwater Security, Smith's initial vision has undeniably shaped and transformed a decade of war. He argues that this gray area-and its warriors who occupy the controversial space between public and private-has become an indispensable element of the modern battlefield.","authors":{"author":{"id":"8058078","name":"Jamie   Smith","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1473783185p5/8058078.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1473783185p2/8058078.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8058078.Jamie_Smith","average_rating":"3.48","ratings_count":"206","text_reviews_count":"37"}},"published":"","work":{"id":"40488993","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6mYCbo3nDESSP1fOgDbt6w"}},{"id":{"_":"18877271","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":"9780199330874","text_reviews_count":{"_":"13","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.K59atw9ppmFoYQbMAJtgYw","title":"Does Capitalism Have a Future?","title_without_series":"Does Capitalism Have a Future?","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18877271-does-capitalism-have-a-future","num_pages":"","format":"","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"","publication_year":"","publication_month":"","average_rating":"3.87","ratings_count":"153","description":"In Does Capitalism Have a Future?, a global quintet of distinguished scholars cut their way through to the question of whether our capitalist system can survive in the medium run. Despite the current gloom, conventional wisdom still assumes that there is no real alternative to capitalism. The authors argue that this generalization is a mistaken outgrowth of the optimistic nineteenth-century claim that human history ascends through stages to an enlightened equilibrium of liberal capitalism. All major historical systems have broken down in the end, and in the modern epoch several cataclysmic events-notably the French revolution, World War I, and the collapse of the Soviet bloc-came to pass when contemporary political elites failed to calculate the consequences of the processes they presumed to govern. At present, none of our governing elites and very few intellectuals can fathom a systemic collapse in the coming decades. While the book's contributors arrive at different conclusions, they are in constant dialogue with one another, and they construct a relatively seamless-if open-ended-whole. Written by five of world's most respected scholars of global historical trends, this ambitious book asks the most important of questions: are we on the cusp of a radical world historical shift?","authors":{"author":{"id":"30957","name":"Immanuel Wallerstein","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1230437178p5/30957.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1230437178p2/30957.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30957.Immanuel_Wallerstein","average_rating":"3.92","ratings_count":"3943","text_reviews_count":"293"}},"published":"","work":{"id":"26851158","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.gVSV5MlFzhOBJU6ABGsGxA"}},{"id":{"_":"251940","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0609810464","isbn13":"9780609810460","text_reviews_count":{"_":"49","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.TtWt5HaEX54NZKhCEf-r1w","title":"The Finishing School: Earning the Navy SEAL Trident","title_without_series":"The Finishing School: Earning the Navy SEAL Trident","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/251940.The_Finishing_School","num_pages":"304","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"Three Rivers Press","publication_day":"31","publication_year":"2005","publication_month":"5","average_rating":"4.14","ratings_count":"1934","description":"In America’s new war, the first guns in the fight are special operations forces, including the Navy SEALs, specially trained warriors who operate with precision, swiftness, and lethal force.

From there, the men enter operational platoons, where they subordinate their individual abilities to the mission of the group and train for special operations in specific geographic environments. <br /><br />Never before has a civilian writer been granted such close access to the training of America’s most elite military forces. <i>The Finishing School</i> is essential reading for anyone who wants to know what goes into the making of America’s best warriors.","authors":{"author":{"id":"88189","name":"Dick Couch","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/88189.Dick_Couch","average_rating":"4.11","ratings_count":"17121","text_reviews_count":"882"}},"published":"2005","work":{"id":"244130","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.axTtzBdSRyiEOErz0fn5Lw"}},{"id":{"_":"115614","type":"integer"},"isbn":"074356149X","isbn13":"9780743561495","text_reviews_count":{"_":"9","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.U26d3TB1NnwnjpYgHyWwJA","title":"The Ultimate Goals Program: How To Get Everything You Want Faster Than You Thought Possible","title_without_series":"The Ultimate Goals Program: How To Get Everything You Want Faster Than You Thought Possible","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/115614.The_Ultimate_Goals_Program","num_pages":"0","format":"Audio CD","edition_information":"","publisher":"Simon  Schuster Audio/Nightingale-Conant","publication_day":"9","publication_year":"2007","publication_month":"1","average_rating":"4.23","ratings_count":"133","description":"The author of <i>The Psychology of Achievement</i> and <i>Eat That Frog!</i> reveals the most important skill you can ever learn. <br /><br /> Your ability to set and achieve goals will determine your success and happiness more than any other skill.

Every day more than fifteen million people earn their keep by persuading someone else to make a purchase.<br /><br />But dig deeper and a startling truth emerges:<br /><br />Yes, one in nine Americans works in sales. <i>But so</i> <i>do the other eight</i>.<br /><br />Whether we’re employees pitching colleagues on a new idea, entrepreneurs enticing funders to invest, or parents and teachers cajoling children to study, we spend our days trying to move others.

Pink draws on a rich trove of social science for his counterintuitive insights. He reveals the new ABCs of moving others (it's no longer \"Always Be Closing\"), explains why extraverts don't make the best salespeople, and shows how giving people an \"off-ramp\" for their actions can matter more than actually changing their minds.<br /><br />Along the way, Pink describes the six successors to the elevator pitch, the three rules for understanding another's perspective, the five frames that can make your message clearer and more persuasive, and much more. The result is a perceptive and practical book--one that will change how you see the world and transform what you do at work, at school, and at home.","authors":{"author":{"id":"96150","name":"Daniel H.

Never again will you think about thinking the same way.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? <br /><br />In <i>Blink</i> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \"blink\": the election of Warren Harding; \"New Coke\"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \"thin-slicing\" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1439","name":"Malcolm Gladwell","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p5/1439.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p2/1439.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1439.Malcolm_Gladwell","average_rating":"4.01","ratings_count":"2182054","text_reviews_count":"85962"}},"published":"2007","work":{"id":"1180927","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.qYWy3fKK-YHr5-a-JLzv2Q"}},{"id":{"_":"22798864","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1414336276","isbn13":"9781414336275","text_reviews_count":{"_":"432","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.e1bJSHRa0OY7dKMvGV_V1A","title":"The Third Target (J.

Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.<br /><br />Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.<br /><br />An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.<br /><br />What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. <br /><br />They succeeded by transforming habits.<br /><br />In <i>The Power of Habit, </i>award-winning <i>New York Times</i> business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. <br /><br />Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.<br /><br />At its core, <i>The Power of Habit</i> contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. <br /><br />Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.","authors":{"author":{"id":"5201530","name":"Charles Duhigg","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1349273209p5/5201530.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1349273209p2/5201530.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5201530.Charles_Duhigg","average_rating":"4.09","ratings_count":"381703","text_reviews_count":"19598"}},"published":"2012","work":{"id":"17624817","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.gRJ7ixmb9Hyc0lfIw7m6og"}},{"id":{"_":"18176747","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0062273205","isbn13":"9780062273208","text_reviews_count":{"_":"2552","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.CSf1AlzG9n9OsClYOs4SMw","title":"The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers","title_without_series":"The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386609333l/18176747._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386609333l/18176747._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things","num_pages":"304","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Harper Business","publication_day":"4","publication_year":"2014","publication_month":"3","average_rating":"4.24","ratings_count":"59309","description":"A lot of people talk about how great it is to start a business, but only Ben Horowitz is brutally honest about how hard it is to run one.<br /><br />In <em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</em>, Ben Horowitz, cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and one of Silicon Valley's most respected and experienced entrepreneurs, draws on his own story of founding, running, selling, buying, managing, and investing in technology companies to offer essential advice and practical wisdom for navigating the toughest problems business schools don't cover.

Greatness doesn't come from DNA but from practice and perseverance honed over decades. The key is how you practice, how you analyze the results of your progress and learn from your mistakes, that enables you to achieve greatness.<br /><br />Colvin shows that the skills of business: negotiating deals, evaluating financial statements obey the principles that lead to greatness, so that anyone can get better at them with the right kind of effort. Even the hardest decisions and interactions can be systematically improved.<br /><br />This new mind-set, combined with Colvin's practical advice, will change the way you think about your job and career, and will inspire you to achieve more in all you do.","authors":{"author":{"id":"988764","name":"Geoff Colvin","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/988764.Geoff_Colvin","average_rating":"3.95","ratings_count":"17821","text_reviews_count":"1102"}},"published":"2008","work":{"id":"4642546","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.lbFkPG80HeUIJvHiiCk5dA"}},{"id":{"_":"22609444","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1476709564","isbn13":"9781476709567","text_reviews_count":{"_":"356","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.f1wZkkxccMQRfCoexvJCfQ","title":"Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World","title_without_series":"Bold: How to Go Big, Create Wealth and Impact the World","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422848692l/22609444._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422848692l/22609444._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22609444-bold","num_pages":"336","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Simon  Schuster","publication_day":"3","publication_year":"2015","publication_month":"2","average_rating":"4.02","ratings_count":"8423","description":"<i>Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26596460-bold\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">here</a></i><br /><br />From the coauthors of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Abundance</i> comes their much anticipated follow-up: <i>Bold</i>—a radical, how-to guide for using exponential technologies, moonshot thinking, and crowd-powered tools to create extraordinary wealth while also positively impacting the lives of billions.<br /><br /><i>Bold</i> unfolds in three parts. Part One focuses on the exponential technologies that are disrupting today’s Fortune 500 companies and enabling upstart entrepreneurs to go from \"I’ve got an idea\" to \"I run a billion-dollar company\" far faster than ever before. The authors provide exceptional insight into the power of 3D printing, artificial intelligence, robotics, networks and sensors, and synthetic biology. Part Two of the book focuses on the Psychology of Bold, drawing on insights from billionaire entrepreneurs Larry Page, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jeff Bezos. In addition, Diamandis reveals his entrepreneurial secrets garnered from building fifteen companies, including such audacious ventures as Singularity University, XPRIZE, Planetary Resources, and Human Longevity, Inc. Finally, <i>Bold</i> closes with a look at the best practices that allow anyone to leverage today’s hyper-connected crowd like never before. Here, the authors teach how to design and use incentive competitions, launch million-dollar crowdfunding campaigns to tap into ten’s of billions of dollars of capital, and finally how to build communities—armies of exponentially enabled individuals willing and able to help today’s entrepreneurs make their boldest dreams come true.<br /><br /><i>Bold</i> is both a manifesto and a manual. It is today’s exponential entrepreneur’s go-to resource on the use of emerging technologies, thinking at scale, and the awesome power of crowd-powered tools.","authors":{"author":{"id":"5376311","name":"Peter H.

The cause of their failure was a complete mystery.<br /><br />Five months later, a seemingly unrelated event occurred. A computer security firm in Belarus was called in to troubleshoot some computers in Iran that were caught in a reboot loop—crashing and rebooting repeatedly. At first, technicians with the firm believed the malicious code they found on the machines was a simple, routine piece of malware. But as they and other experts around the world investigated, they discovered a virus of unparalleled complexity and mysterious provenance and intent. They had, they soon learned, stumbled upon the world’s first digital weapon.<br /><br />Stuxnet, as it came to be known, was unlike any other virus or worm built before: It was the first attack that reached beyond the computers it targeted to physically destroy the equipment those computers controlled. It was an ingenious attack, jointly engineered by the United States and Israel, that worked exactly as planned, until the rebooting machines gave it all away. <br /><br />And the discovery of Stuxnet was just the beginning: Once the digital weapon was uncovered and deciphered, it provided clues to other tools lurking in the wild. Soon, security experts found and exposed not one but three highly sophisticated digital spy tools that came from the same labs that created Stuxnet. The discoveries gave the world its first look at the scope and sophistication of nation-state surveillance and warfare in the digital age.<br /><br />Kim Zetter, a senior reporter at Wired, has covered hackers and computer security since 1999 and is one of the top journalists in the world on this beat. She was among the first reporters to cover Stuxnet after its discovery and has authored many of the most comprehensive articles about it. In COUNTDOWN TO ZERO DAY: Stuxnet and the Launch of the World’s First Digital Weapon, Zetter expands on this work to show how the code was designed and unleashed and how its use opened a Pandora’s Box, ushering in an age of digital warfare in which any country’s infrastructure—power grids, nuclear plants, oil pipelines, dams—is vulnerable to the same kind of attack with potentially devastating results. A sophisticated digital strike on portions of the power grid, for example, could plunge half the U.S. into darkness for weeks or longer, having a domino effect on all other critical infrastructures dependent on electricity.","authors":{"author":{"id":"193204","name":"Kim Zetter","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n","nophoto":"true"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/193204.Kim_Zetter","average_rating":"4.14","ratings_count":"5120","text_reviews_count":"542"}},"published":"2014","work":{"id":"26123986","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.RRk9PuecsNP7qmZe85oyhQ"}},{"id":{"_":"22608582","type":"integer"},"isbn":"1455530093","isbn13":"9781455530090","text_reviews_count":{"_":"1149","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.W6mw8DKBL0ND3t8eWT8g9w","title":"13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened In Benghazi","title_without_series":"13 Hours: The Inside Account of What Really Happened In Benghazi","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411493281l/22608582._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411493281l/22608582._SY75_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22608582-13-hours","num_pages":"432","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"Large Print","publisher":"Twelve","publication_day":"30","publication_year":"2014","publication_month":"9","average_rating":"4.29","ratings_count":"18188","description":"<b>The harrowing, true account from the brave men on the ground who fought back during the Battle of Benghazi.</b><br /><br /> <i>13 Hours</i> presents, for the first time ever, the true account of the events of September 11, 2012, when terrorists attacked the US State Department Special Mission Compound and a nearby CIA station called the Annex in Benghazi, Libya.

It is a <i>systematic discipline</i> for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  <br /><br />By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.<br /><br />Essentialism is not one more thing – it’s a whole new way of doing everything.

He argues that Musk is an amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs.

This is the remarkable true story of a man who lived alone in the woods of Maine for 27 years, making this dream a reality--not out of anger at the world, but simply because he preferred to live on his own.</b> In 1986, a shy and intelligent twenty-year-old named Christopher Knight left his home in Massachusetts, drove to Maine, and disappeared into the forest. He would not have a conversation with another human being until nearly three decades later, when he was arrested for stealing food. Living in a tent even through brutal winters, he had survived by his wits and courage, developing ingenious ways to store edibles and water, and to avoid freezing to death. He broke into nearby cottages for food, clothing, reading material, and other provisions, taking only what he needed but terrifying a community never able to solve the mysterious burglaries. Based on extensive interviews with Knight himself, this is a vividly detailed account of his secluded life--why did he leave? what did he learn?--as well as the challenges he has faced since returning to the world. It is a gripping story of survival that asks fundamental questions about solitude, community, and what makes a good life, and a deeply moving portrait of a man who was determined to live his own way, and succeeded.","authors":{"author":{"id":"206768","name":"Michael Finkel","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1484405381p5/206768.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1484405381p2/206768.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/206768.Michael_Finkel","average_rating":"3.87","ratings_count":"61139","text_reviews_count":"6942"}},"published":"2017","work":{"id":"51228990","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.P80LdcE09viCxfkevgmubg"}},{"id":{"_":"7644744","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0262692341","isbn13":"9780262692342","text_reviews_count":{"_":"1","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.WwMjkLh_Xm87RzBDJouayQ","title":"Investment Intelligence from Insider Trading","title_without_series":"Investment Intelligence from Insider Trading","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png","small_image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7644744-investment-intelligence-from-insider-trading","num_pages":"442","format":"Paperback","edition_information":"","publisher":"MIT Press","publication_day":"28","publication_year":"2000","publication_month":"2","average_rating":"3.56","ratings_count":"16","description":"<b>Learn how to profit from information about insider trading.</b><br /><br />The term insider trading refers to the stock transactions of the officers, directors, and large shareholders of a firm. Many investors believe that corporate insiders, informed about their firms' prospects, buy and sell their own firm's stock at favorable times, reaping significant profits. Given the extra costs and risks of an active trading strategy, the key question for stock market investors is whether the publicly available insider-trading information can help them to outperform a simple passive index fund.<br /><br />Basing his insights on an exhaustive data set that captures information on all reported insider trading in all publicly held firms over the past twenty-one years--over one million transactions!--H. Nejat Seyhun shows how investors can use insider information to their advantage. He documents the magnitude and duration of the stock price movements following insider trading, determinants of insiders' profits, and the risks associated with imitating insider trading. He looks at the likely performance of individual firms and of the overall stock market, and compares the value of what one can learn from insider trading with commonly used measures of value such as price-earnings ratio, book-to-market ratio, and dividend yield.","authors":{"author":{"id":"3344585","name":"H.

That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink (author of <i>To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others</i>). In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home—is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.<br /><br />Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does—and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation—autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live.","authors":{"author":{"id":"96150","name":"Daniel H.

Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1439","name":"Malcolm Gladwell","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p5/1439.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p2/1439.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1439.Malcolm_Gladwell","average_rating":"4.01","ratings_count":"2182054","text_reviews_count":"85962"}},"published":"2008","work":{"id":"3364437","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.AiSrCsUeSMMsC_IUy2R8Cg"}},{"id":{"_":"11468377","type":"integer"},"isbn":"0374275637","isbn13":"9780374275631","text_reviews_count":{"_":"9583","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.aqJnwnCXHPC4HdqN5M_tQA","title":"Thinking, Fast and Slow","title_without_series":"Thinking, Fast and Slow","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317793965l/11468377._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317793965l/11468377._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow","num_pages":"499","format":"Hardcover","edition_information":"","publisher":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux","publication_day":"25","publication_year":"2011","publication_month":"10","average_rating":"4.16","ratings_count":"322663","description":"In the highly anticipated <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i>, Kahneman takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.<br /><br />Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i> will transform the way you think about thinking.","authors":{"author":{"id":"72401","name":"Daniel Kahneman","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1605420588p5/72401.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1605420588p2/72401.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/72401.Daniel_Kahneman","average_rating":"4.16","ratings_count":"328036","text_reviews_count":"11672"}},"published":"2011","work":{"id":"16402639","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.fgboBCvf-38t9A7bG3aJrg"}},{"id":{"_":"15847933","type":"integer"},"isbn":{"nil":"true"},"isbn13":{"nil":"true"},"text_reviews_count":{"_":"26","type":"integer"},"uri":"kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.tLOOiHfDWD5HKrGksuEBIQ","title":"Confident Ruby","title_without_series":"Confident Ruby","image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398328834l/15847933._SX98_.jpg","small_image_url":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398328834l/15847933._SX50_.jpg","large_image_url":"","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15847933-confident-ruby","num_pages":"296","format":"ebook","edition_information":"","publisher":"","publication_day":"5","publication_year":"2012","publication_month":"6","average_rating":"4.39","ratings_count":"350","description":"","authors":{"author":{"id":"4971702","name":"Avdi Grimm","role":"","image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1442597806p5/4971702.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"small_image_url":{"_":"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1442597806p2/4971702.jpg\n","nophoto":"false"},"link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4971702.Avdi_Grimm","average_rating":"4.21","ratings_count":"753","text_reviews_count":"62"}},"published":"2012","work":{"id":"21593043","uri":"kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.YERDCcC7xxuW-7UFaeDY1g"}}]}}
