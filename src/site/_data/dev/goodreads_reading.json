And it’s haunting Harry Pottter’s dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night, screaming in terror?<br /><br />Harry has a lot on his mind for this, his fifth year at Hogwarts: a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a big surprise on the Gryffindor Quidditch team; and the looming terror of the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams. But all these things pale next to the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named - a threat that neither the magical government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop.<br /><br />As the grasp of darkness tightens, Harry must discover the true depth and strength of his friends, the importance of boundless loyalty, and the shocking price of unbearable sacrifice.<br /><br />His fate depends on them all.","authors":{"author":{"id":"1077326","name":"J.K.
