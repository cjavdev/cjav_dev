title: Working with CJ

This is a place where I'm working through some self reflection and might be
valuable as a bit of a "working with CJ" or some insights to help more quickly
start collaborating effectively.

### About my life

Born and raised in the Sierra Nevadas on the North shore of Lake Tahoe. Our
family moved from Kings Beach, CA to Reno, NV when I was 13. Attended high
school (Manogue) and college (UNR) in Reno. Nicole and I were married in 2010.
We have two boys who are 15 months apart in age. Growing up, I snow and water
skied, wake and snow boarded, and was very into BMX -- üö≤ bikes are still a big
part of my life.


### About my career

I've had a really odd and varied career journey.

I started trading code for money in 2005 when I got a job that I was woefully
unqualified for in a seismology lab. I was writing perl, learning vi, and using
a sun solaris machine. After that I started buildng websites in classic asp, a
little php, and then for many years with .NET.

While in college studying Computer Science, I joined the Nevada Army National
Guard which took me on deployment to Afghanistan in 2011 -- a year where I
learned a ton about networking and security.

After college, I had a couple jobs where I wrote code in the Microsoft
ecosystem: VB.NET (finance / stock trading), ASP.NET (liquid handling
robotics).

In 2013, I found and fell in love ‚ô•Ô∏è with Ruby. I attended, then taught at App
Academy (Rails bootcamp in SF). In 2015, Nicole and I decided to move back to
Northern Nevada from the Bay Area and I took a remote job working for MyVR, a
platform for vacation rental managers. Here, I learned python, django, and
angular and built a ton of API integrations.

In 2019, I made the move from product engineer to support engineering at Stripe
where I had the opportunity to help more developers learn how to build API
integrations. In 2020, I again shifted a bit into Developer Advocacy --  a role
where I'm able to work across dozens of technologies to build demos and videos
to help grow the GDP of the internet.


### Reaching me

- If we work at the same place, Slack DM is always welcome
- If we dont work at the same place, Twitter DM is the next best thing
- Email me if you need a paper trail
- I ignore any phone calls from numbers I don't recognize

### Things I care about

- **Passionate execution**: Do everything to the best of your ability and work hard to get better.
- **Hacker ethos**: bend the spoon; do things that don't scale;
- **Respect**: Have regard for the abilities, qualities, and achievements of users and colleagues alike.
- **Grit**: perseverance for long-term and meaningful goals ([book rec](https://amzn.to/2GlEzIU)).
- **Impact**: Have a strong (measurable) effect on someone or something
- **Ownership**: be responsible for tasks which you directly control and for tasks that affect whether or not your mission is successful ([book rec](https://amzn.to/3embWYK)).
- **Freedom and responsibility**: Set your own schedule and be held accountable for your actions.


### My working style

- **FILO Tornado Stack**: I will start a task 1, get an interrupt for task 2
and start working quickly on task 2, get an interrupt for task 3 and quickly
bang out task 3, then go back to task 2, get an interrupt for task 4 and bang
out task 4, then go back to task 2 to complete, then go back to task 1 to
complete. Tornado because I'll often move from thing to thing haphazardly
keeping track of tasks in a quick and dirty TODO list.
- **Dreamer**: I love to brainstorm and get a lot of energy from trying to
think of creative ways to solve problems.
- **Starter**: I'm super good at starting new things. It takes a lot of will
power and effort to drive them to 100% completion, but I can get there.


### Some context about what follows

I've been told that I can be quite rigid in my perspective of how the world
works. That I live by a bit of a "CJ's rules for life" that might be different
from most. I'm going to try to capture some of that here.


### Unreasonably high expectations

I tend to have unrealistic expectations for myself. These expecations sometimes
begin to fall onto others (unfairly) and its something I have to work really
hard to combat. Telling myself "X is good enough" when X is my own or others
work. Its a challenge to know where to draw the line.

An unfortunate side effect is that sometimes I worry that something wont be
done to the bar I've set, so I tend to say "yes" to way too many things from a
dillusional place of thinking that I might be able to do it better (rarely
true).

It takes effort for me to see others perspectives and without full and clear
context from others, I can sometimes jump to the default conclusion that
something didn't happen the way I envisioned it.

Given I want to achieve, compete, push hard, something I've found really useful
is to constantly ask for feedback from peers and managers, especially outside
of the standard performance cycles so that I learn my blind spots.

### Rush to accommodate

It's better to rush to accommodate others rather than "taking it easy" if
others are waiting. Even to the point of being a martyr, I feel like one way we
can help others is to be on-time, and avoid making anyone wait. I hate being
late to meetings.

This also manifests as being poor at advocating for myself.


### High bias for action

My bias is generally to manifest something. Take action and iterate. This comes
at a cost of not fully thinking things all the way through before diving in.


### Juggling and prioritizing

I tend to have very high output.  This can lead to some slop in areas that I'm
not passionate about or that I don't consider important. If something is
especially important to you on a project I'm executing for you or with you,
please let me know so that I can actively prioritize.

One example: I am horrible at CSS and I while I could invest in getting better
at that, I've mostly just learned enough to get by.
