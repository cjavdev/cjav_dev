Periodically, I'll create random mental and physical challenges
designed (or not designed?) to create change within
myself.

This post is an attempt to catalog several challenges
and some of the memories from each.


## 2020

I started doing some intermittent and even a couple longer
fasts this year. I also tried the keto diet for a while.

My brother JP challenged me to a 100 squat per day challenge
in September which snowballed into a few more months of random
challenges with the goal being 100 reps of some exercise per
day.

Each day, we'd text an iMessage thread with a timelapse video
of us doing our exercise.

**September**: 100 squats/day

**October**: 100 push-ups/day
